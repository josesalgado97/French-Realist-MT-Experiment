'I have come to fight with you, Sir,' and he rapidly explained the situation. M. Charles de Beauvoisis, after giving it careful thought, was quite sat- isfied with the cut of Julien's black coat. 'From Staub's, clearly,' he said to himself, listening to him in silence, 'that waistcoat is in good taste, the boots are right; but, on the other hand, that black coat in the early morn- ing! ... It will be to stop the bullet,' thought the Chevalier de Beauvoisis. As soon as he had furnished himself with this explanation, he reverted to a perfect politeness, and addressed Julien almost as an equal. The dis- cussion lasted for some time, it was a delicate matter; but in the end Juli- en could not reject the evidence of his own eyes. The well-bred young man whom he saw before him bore no resemblance whatsoever to the rude person who, the day before, had insulted him. Julien felt an invincible reluctance to go away, he prolonged the ex- planation. He observed the self-sufficiency of the Chevalier de Beauvois- is, for such was the style that he had adopted in referring to himself, shocked at Julien's addressing him as Monsieur, pure and simple. He admired the other's gravity, blended with a certain modest fatuity but never discarded for a single instant. He was astonished by the curi- ous way in which his tongue moved as he enunciated his words ... But after all, in all this, there was not the slightest reason to pick a quarrel with him. The young diplomat offered to fight with great courtesy, but the ex- Lieutenant of the 96th, who had been sitting for an hour with his legs apart, his hands on his hips and his arms akimbo, decided that his friend, M. Sorel, was not the sort of person to pick a quarrel, in the Ger- man fashion, with another man, because that man's visiting cards had been stolen. Julien left the house in the worst of tempers. The Chevalier de Beauvoisis's carriage was waiting for him in the courtyard, in front of the

steps; as it happened, Julien raised his eyes and recognised his man of the previous day in the coachman. Seeing him, grasping him by the skirts of his coat, pulling him down from his box and belabouring him with his whip, were the work of a mo- ment. Two lackeys tried to defend their fellow; Julien received a pum- melling: immediately he drew one of his pocket pistols and fired at them; they took to their heels. It was all over in a minute. The Chevalier de Beauvoisis came slowly downstairs with the most charming gravity, repeating in the accents of a great nobleman: 'What's this? What's this?' His curiosity was evidently aroused, but his diplomat- ic importance did not allow him to show any sign of interest. When he learned what the matter was, a lofty pride still struggled in his features against the slightly playful coolness which ought never to be absent from the face of a diplomat. The Lieutenant of the 96th realised that M. de Beauvoisis was anxious to fight; he wished also, diplomatically enough, to preserve for his friend the advantages of the initiative. 'This time,' he cried, 'there are grounds for a duel!' 'I should think so,' replied the diplomat. 'I dismiss that rascal,' he said to his servants; 'someone else must drive.' They opened the carriage door: the Chevalier insisted that Julien and his second should get in before him. They went to find a friend of M. de Beauvoisis, who suggested a quiet spot. The conversation as they drove to it was perfect. The only odd thing was the diplomat in undress. 'These gentlemen, although of the highest nobility,' thought Julien, 'are not in the least boring like the people who come to dine with M. de La Mole; and I can see why,' he added a moment later, 'they are not ashamed to be indecent.' They were speaking of the dancers whom the public had applauded in a ballet of the previous evening. The gentlemen made allusions to spicy anecdotes of which Julien and his second, the Lieutenant of the 96th, were entirely ignorant. Julien did not make the mistake of pretending to know them; he admitted his ignorance with good grace. This frankness found favour with the Chevalier's friend; he repeated the anecdotes to him in full detail, and extremely well. One thing astonished Julien vastly. A station which was being erected in the middle of the street for the Corpus Christi day procession, held up the carriage for a moment. The gentlemen indulged in a number of pleasantries; the cure, according to them, was the son of an Archbishop. Never, in the house of the Marquis de La Mole, who hoped to become a Duke, would anyone have dared to say such a thing.

The duel was over in an instant: Julien received a bullet in his arm; they bound it up for him with handkerchiefs; these were soaked in brandy, and the Chevalier de Beauvoisis asked Julien most politely to al- low him to take him home, in the carriage that had brought them. When Julien gave his address as the Hotel de La Mole, the young diplomat and his friend exchanged glances. Julien's cab was waiting, but he found these gentlemen's conversation infinitely more amusing than that of the worthy Lieutenant of the 96th. 'Good God! A duel, is that all?' thought Julien. 'How fortunate I was to come across that coachman again! What a misfortune, if I had had to en- dure that insult a second time in a cafe!' The amusing conversation had scarcely been interrupted. Julien now understood that the affectation of a diplomat does serve some purpose. 'So dullness is by no means inherent,' he said to himself, 'in a conversa- tion between people of high birth! These men make fun of the Corpus Christi day procession, they venture to repeat highly scabrous anecdotes, and with picturesque details. Positively the only thing lacking to them is judgment in politics, and this deficiency is more than made up for by the charm of their tone and the perfect aptness of their expressions.' Julien felt himself keenly attracted to them. 'How glad I should be to see them often!' No sooner had they parted than the Chevalier de Beauvoisis hastened in search of information: what he heard was by no means promising. He was extremely curious to know his man better; could he with de- cency call upon him? The scanty information he managed to obtain was not of an encouraging nature. 'This is frightful!' he said to his second. 'It is impossible for me to ad- mit that I have fought a duel with a mere secretary of M. de La Mole, and that because I have been robbed of my visiting cards by a coachman.' 'Certainly the whole story leaves one exposed to ridicule.' That evening, the Chevalier de Beauvoisis spread the report every- where that this M. Sorel, who incidentally was a perfectly charming young man, was the natural son of an intimate friend of the Marquis de La Mole. The rumour passed without difficulty. As soon as it was estab- lished, the young diplomat and his friend deigned to pay Julien several visits, during the fortnight for which he was confined to his room. Julien confessed to them that he had never in his life been to the Opera. 'This is terrible,' they told him, 'where else does one go? Your first out- ing must be to the Comte Ory.'

At the Opera, the Chevalier de Beauvoisis presented him to the fam- ous singer Geronimo, who was enjoying an immense success that season. Julien almost paid court to the Chevalier; his blend of self-respect, mysterious importance and boyish fatuity enchanted him. For instance, the Chevalier stammered slightly because he had the honour to be fre- quently in the company of a great nobleman who suffered from that in- firmity. Never had Julien seen combined in a single person the absurdity which keeps one amused and the perfection of manners which a poor provincial must seek to copy. He was seen at the Opera with the Chevalier de Beauvoisis; their asso- ciation caused his name to be mentioned. 'Well, Sir!' M. de La Mole said to him one day, 'and so you are the nat- ural son of a rich gentleman of the Franche-Comte, my intimate friend!' The Marquis cut Julien short when he tried to protest that he had in no way helped to give currency to this rumour. 'M. de Beauvoisis did not wish to have fought a duel with a carpenter's son.' 'I know, I know,' said M. de La Mole; 'it rests with me now to give con- sistency to the story, which suits me. But I have one favour to ask you, which will cost you no more than half an hour of your time: every Opera evening, at half-past eleven, go and stand in the vestibule when the people of fashion are coming out. I still notice provincial mannerisms in you at times, you must get rid of them; besides, it can do you no harm to know, at least by sight, important personages to whom I may one day have occasion to send you. Call at the box office to have yourself identi- fied; they have placed your name on the list.'

Chapter An Attack of Gout And I received promotion, not on my own merits, but because my master had the gout. BERTOLOTTI The reader is perhaps surprised at this free and almost friendly tone; we have forgotten to say that for six weeks the Marquis had been con- fined to the house by an attack of gout. Mademoiselle de La Mole and her mother were at Hyeres, with the Marquise's mother. Comte Norbert saw his father only for brief mo- ments; they were on the best of terms, but had nothing to say to one an- other. M. de La Mole, reduced to Julien's company, was astonished to find him endowed with ideas. He made him read the newspapers aloud. Soon the young secretary was able to select the interesting passages. There was a new paper which the Marquis abhorred; he had vowed that he would never read it, and spoke of it every day. Julien laughed. The Marquis, out of patience with the times, made Julien read him Livy; the translation improvised from the Latin text amused him. One day the Marquis said, with that tone of over-elaborate politeness, which often tried Julien's patience: 'Allow me, my dear Sorel, to make you the present of a blue coat: when it suits you to put it on and to pay me a visit, you will be, in my eyes, the younger brother of the Comte de Chaulnes, that is to say, the son of my old friend the Duke.' Julien was somewhat in the dark as to what was happening; that even- ing he ventured to pay a visit in his blue coat. The Marquis treated him as an equal. Julien had a heart capable of appreciating true politeness, but he had no idea of the finer shades. He would have sworn, before this caprice of the Marquis, that it would be impossible to be received by him with greater deference. 'What a marvellous talent!' Julien said to himself; when he rose to go, the Marquis apologised for not being able to see him to the door on account of his gout.

Julien was obsessed by this strange idea: 'Can he be laughing at me?' he wondered. He went to seek the advice of the abbe Pirard, who, less courteous than the Marquis, answered him only with a whistle and changed the subject. The following morning Julien appeared before the Marquis, in a black coat, with his portfolio and the letters to be signed. He was received in the old manner. That evening, in his blue coat, it was with an entirely different tone and one in every way as polite as the evening before. 'Since you appear to find some interest in the visits which you are so kind as to pay to a poor, suffering old man,' the Marquis said to him, 'you must speak to him of all the little incidents in your life, but openly, and without thinking of anything but how to relate them clearly and in an amusing fashion. For one must have amusement,' the Marquis went on; 'that is the only real thing in life. A man cannot save my life on a battle-field every day, nor can he make me every day the present of a million; but if I had Rivarol here, by my couch, every day, he would re- lieve me of an hour of pain and boredom. I saw a great deal of him at Hamburg, during the Emigration.' And the Marquis told Julien stories of Rivarol among the Hamburgers, who would club together in fours to elucidate the point of a witty saying. M. de La Mole, reduced to the society of this young cleric, sought to enliven him. He stung Julien's pride. Since he was asked for the truth, Julien determined to tell his whole story; but with the suppression of two things: his fanatical admiration for a name which made the Marquis furi- ous, and his entire unbelief, which hardly became a future cure. His little affair with the Chevalier de Beauvoisis arrived most opportunely. The Marquis laughed till he cried at the scene in the cafe in the Rue Saint- Honore, with the coachman who covered him with foul abuse. It was a period of perfect frankness in the relations between employer and protege. M. de La Mole became interested in this singular character. At first, he played with Julien's absurdities, for his own entertainment; soon he found it more interesting to correct, in the gentlest manner, the young man's mistaken view of life. 'Most provincials who come to Paris admire everything,' thought the Marquis; 'this fellow hates everything. They have too much sentiment, he has not enough, and fools take him for a fool.' The attack of gout was prolonged by the wintry weather and lasted for some months.

'One becomes attached to a fine spaniel,' the Marquis told himself; 'why am I so ashamed of becoming attached to this young cleric? He is original. I treat him like a son; well, what harm is there in that! This fancy, if it lasts, will cost me a diamond worth five hundred louis in my will.' Once the Marquis had realised the firm character of his protege, he en- trusted him with some fresh piece of business every day. Julien noticed with alarm that this great nobleman would occasionally give him contradictory instructions with regard to the same matter. This was liable to land him in serious trouble. Julien, when he came to work with the Marquis, invariably brought a diary in which he wrote down his instructions, and the Marquis initialled them. Julien had en- gaged a clerk who copied out the instructions relative to each piece of business in a special book. In this book were kept also copies of all letters. This idea seemed at first the most ridiculous and tiresome thing ima- ginable. But, in less than two months, the Marquis realised its advant- ages. Julien suggested engaging a clerk from a bank, who should keep an account by double entry of all the revenue from and expenditure on the estates of which he himself had charge. These measures so enlightened the Marquis as to his own financial po- sition that he was able to give himself the pleasure of embarking on two or three fresh speculations without the assistance of his broker, who had been robbing him. 'Take three thousand francs for yourself,' he said, one day to his young minister. 'But, Sir, my conduct may be criticised.' 'What do you want, then?' replied the Marquis, with irritation. 'I want you to be so kind as to make a formal agreement, and to write it down yourself in the book; the agreement will award me a sum of three thousand francs. Besides, it was M. l'abbe Pirard who first thought of all this book-keeping.' The Marquis, with the bored expression of the Marquis de Moncade, listening to M. Poisson, his steward, reading his accounts, wrote out his instructions. In the evening, when Julien appeared in his blue coat, there was never any talk of business. The Marquis's kindness was so flattering to our hero's easily wounded vanity that presently, in spite of himself, he felt a sort of attachment to this genial old man. Not that Julien was sensitive, as the word is understood in Paris; but he was not a monster, and no one, since the death of the old Surgeon-Major, had spoken to him so

kindly. He remarked with astonishment that the Marquis showed a po- lite consideration for his self-esteem which he had never received from the old surgeon. Finally he realised that the surgeon had been prouder of his Cross than the Marquis was of his Blue Riband. The Marquis was the son of a great nobleman. One day, at the end of a morning interview, in his black coat, and for the discussion of business, Julien amused the Marquis, who kept him for a couple of hours, and positively insisted upon giving him a handful of bank notes which his broker had just brought him from the Bourse. 'I hope, Monsieur le Marquis, not to be wanting in the profound re- spect which I owe you if I ask you to allow me to say something.' 'Speak, my friend.' 'Will Monsieur le Marquis be graciously pleased to let me decline this gift. It is not to the man in black that it is offered, and it would at once put an end to the liberties which he is so kind as to tolerate from the man in blue.' He bowed most respectfully, and left the room without looking round. This attitude amused the Marquis, who reported it that evening to the abbe Pirard. 'There is something that I must at last confess to you, my dear abbe. I know the truth about Julien's birth, and I authorise you not to keep this confidence secret. 'His behaviour this morning was noble,' thought the Marquis, 'and I shall ennoble him.' Some time after this, the Marquis was at length able to leave his room. 'Go and spend a couple of months in London,' he told Julien. 'The spe- cial couriers and other messengers will bring you the letters I receive, with my notes. You will write the replies and send them to me, enclosing each letter with its reply. I have calculated that the delay will not amount to more than five days.' As he travelled post along the road to Calais, Julien thought with amazement of the futility of the alleged business on which he was being sent. We shall not describe the feeling of horror, almost of hatred, with which he set foot on English soil. The reader is aware of his insane pas- sion for Bonaparte. He saw in every officer a Sir Hudson Lowe, in every nobleman a Lord Bathurst, ordering the atrocities of Saint Helena, and receiving his reward in ten years of office.

In London he at last made acquaintance with the extremes of fatuity. He made friends with some young Russian gentlemen who initiated him. 'You are predestined, my dear Sorel,' they told him, 'you are endowed by nature with that cold expression a thousand leagues from the sensation of the moment, which we try so hard to assume.' 'You have not understood our age,' Prince Korasoff said to him; 'always do the opposite to what people expect of you. That, upon my honour, is the only religion of the day. Do not be either foolish or affected, for then people will expect foolishness and affectations, and you will not be obey- ing the rule.' Julien covered himself with glory one day in the drawing-room of the Duke of Fitz-Fulke, who had invited him to dine, with Prince Korasoff. The party were kept waiting for an hour. The way in which Julien com- ported himself amid the score of persons who stood waiting is still quoted by the young Secretaries of Embassy in London. His expression was inimitable. He was anxious to meet, notwithstanding his friends the dandies, the celebrated Philip Vane, the one philosopher that England has produced since Locke. He found him completing his seventh year in prison. 'The aristocracy does not take things lightly in this country,' thought Julien; 'in addition to all this, Vane is disgraced, abused,' etc. Julien found him good company; the fury of the aristocracy kept him amused. 'There,' Julien said to himself, as he left the prison, 'is the one cheerful man that I have met in England.' 'The idea of most use to tyrants is that of God,' Vane had said to him. We suppress the rest of the philosopher's system as being cynical. On his return: 'What amusing idea have you brought me from Eng- land?' M. de La Mole asked him. He remained silent. 'What idea have you brought, amusing or not?' the Marquis went on, sharply. 'First of all,' said Julien, 'the wisest man in England is mad for an hour daily; he is visited by the demon of suicide, who is the national deity. 'Secondly, intelligence and genius forfeit twenty-five per cent of their value on landing in England. 'Thirdly, nothing in the world is so beautiful, admirable, moving as the English countryside.' 'Now, it is my turn,' said the Marquis. 'First of all, what made you say, at the ball at the Russian Embassy, that there are in France three hundred thousand young men of five and

twenty who are passionately anxious for war? Do you think that that is quite polite to the Crowned Heads?' 'One never knows what to say in speaking to our great diplomats,' said Julien. They have a mania for starting serious discussions. If one confines oneself to the commonplaces of the newspapers, one is reckoned a fool. If one allows oneself to say something true and novel, they are aston- ished, they do not know how to answer, and next morning, at seven o'clock they send word to one by the First Secretary, that one has been impolite.' 'Not bad,' said the Marquis, with a laugh. 'I wager, however, Master Philosopher, that you have not discovered what you went to England to do.' 'Pardon me,' replied Julien; 'I went there to dine once a week with His Majesty's Ambassador, who is the most courteous of men.' 'You went to secure the Cross which is lying there' the Marquis told him. 'I do not wish to make you lay aside your black coat, and I have grown accustomed to the more amusing tone which I have adopted with the man in blue. Until further orders, understand this: when I see this Cross, you are the younger son of my friend the Duc de Chaulnes, who, without knowing it, has been for the last six months employed in dip- lomacy. Observe,' added the Marquis, with a highly serious air, cutting short Julien's expressions of gratitude, 'that I do not on any account wish you to rise above your station. That is always a mistake, and a misfor- tune both for patron and for protege. When my lawsuits bore you, or when you no longer suit me I shall ask for a good living for you, like that of our friend the abbe Pirard, and nothing more,' the Marquis added, in the driest of tones. This Cross set Julien's pride at rest; he began to talk far more freely. He felt himself less frequently insulted and made a butt by those remarks, susceptible of some scarcely polite interpretation, which, in the course of an animated conversation, may fall from the lips of anyone. His Cross was the cause of an unexpected visit; this was from M. le Baron de Valenod, who came to Paris to thank the Minister for his Barony and to come to an understanding with him. He was going to be appointed Mayor of Verrieres in the place of M. de Renal. Julien was consumed with silent laughter when M. de Valenod gave him to understand that it had just been discovered that M de Renal was a Jacobin. The fact was that, in a new election which was in preparation, the new Baron was the ministerial candidate, and in the combined

constituency of the Department, which in reality was strongly Ultra, it was M. de Renal who was being put forward by the Liberals. It was in vain that Julien tried to learn something of Madame de Renal; the Baron appeared to remember their former rivalry, and was impenet- rable. He ended by asking Julien for his father's vote at the coming elec- tion. Julien promised to write. 'You ought, Monsieur le Chevalier, to introduce me to M. le Marquis de La Mole.' 'Indeed, so I ought,' thought Julien; 'but a rascal like this!' 'To be frank,' he replied, 'I am too humble a person in the Hotel de La Mole to take it upon me to introduce anyone.' Julien told the Marquis everything: that evening he informed him of Valenod's pretension, and gave an account of his life and actions since 1814. 'Not only,' M. de La Mole replied, with a serious air, 'will you intro- duce the new Baron to me tomorrow, but I shall invite him to dine the day after. He will be one of our new Prefects.' 'In that case,' retorted Julien coldly, 'I request the post of Governor of the Poorhouse for my father.' 'Excellent,' said the Marquis, recovering his gaiety; 'granted; I was ex- pecting a sermon. You are growing up.' M. de Valenod informed Julien that the keeper of the lottery office at Verrieres had just died; Julien thought it amusing to bestow this place upon M. de Cholin, the old imbecile whose petition he had picked up in the room occupied there by M. de La Mole. The Marquis laughed heart- ily at the petition which Julien recited as he made him sign the letter ap- plying for this post to the Minister of Finance. No sooner had M. de Cholin been appointed than Julien learned that this post had been requested by the Deputies of the Department for M. Gros, the celebrated geometrician: this noble-hearted man had an income of only fourteen hundred francs, and every year had been lending six hundred francs to the late holder of the post, to help him to bring up his family. Julien was astonished at the effect of what he had done. 'It is nothing,' he told himself; 'I must be prepared for many other acts of injustice, if I am to succeed, and, what is more, must know how to conceal them, un- der a cloak of fine sentimental words: poor M, Gros! It is he that de- served the Cross, it is I that have it, and I must act according to the wishes of the Government that has given it to me.'

Chapter What Is the Decoration that Confers Distinction? Your water does not refresh me, said the thirsty genie. Yet it is the coolest well in all the Diar Bekir. PELLICO One day Julien returned from the charming property of Villequier, on the bank of the Seine, in which M. de La Mole took a special interest be- cause, of all his estates, it was the only one that had belonged to the cel- ebrated Boniface de La Mole. He found at the Hotel the Marquise and her daughter, who had returned from Hyeres. Julien was now a dandy and understood the art of life in Paris. He greeted Mademoiselle de La Mole with perfect coolness. He appeared to remember nothing of the time when she asked him so gaily to tell her all about his way of falling from his horse. Mademoiselle de La Mole found him taller and paler. There was no longer anything provincial about his figure or his attire; not so with his conversation: this was still perceptibly too serious, too positive. In spite of these sober qualities, and thanks to his pride, it conveyed no sense of inferiority; one felt merely that he still regarded too many things as im- portant. But one saw that he was a man who would stand by his word. 'He is wanting in lightness of touch, but not in intelligence,' Ma- demoiselle de La Mole said to her father, as she teased him over the Cross he had given Julien. 'My brother has been asking you for it for the last eighteen months, and he is a La Mole!' 'Yes; but Julien has novelty. That has never been the case with the La Mole you mention.' M. le Duc de Retz was announced. Mathilde felt herself seized by an irresistible desire to yawn; she recog- nised the antique decorations and the old frequenters of the paternal drawing-room. She formed an entirely boring picture of the life she was going to resume in Paris. And yet at Hyeres she had longed for Paris.

'To think that I am nineteen!' she reflected: 'it is the age of happiness, according to all those gilt-edged idiots.' She looked at nine or ten volumes of recent poetry that had accumulated, during her absence in Provence, on the drawing-room table. It was her misfortune to have more intelligence than MM. de Croisenois, de Caylus, de Luz, and the rest of her friends. She could imagine everything that they would say to her about the beautiful sky in Provence, poetry, the south, etc., etc. Those lovely eyes, in which was revealed the most profound boredom, and, what was worse still, a despair of finding any pleasure, came to rest upon Julien. At any rate, he was not exactly like all the rest. 'Monsieur Sorel,' she said in that short, sharp voice, with nothing fem- inine about it, which is used by young women of the highest rank, 'Monsieur Sorel, are you coming to M. de Retz's ball tonight?' 'Mademoiselle, I have not had the honour to be presented to M. le Duc.' (One would have said that these words and the title burned the lips of the proud provincial.) 'He has asked my brother to bring you; and, if you came, you could tell me all about Villequier; there is some talk of our going there in the spring. I should like to know whether the house is habitable, and if the country round it is as pretty as people say. There are so many un- deserved reputations!' Julien made no reply. 'Come to the ball with my brother,' she added, in the driest of tones. Julien made a respectful bow. 'So, even in the middle of a ball, I must render accounts to all the members of the family. Am I not paid to be their man of business?' In his ill humour, he added: 'Heaven only knows whether what I tell the daughter may not upset the plans of her father, and brother, and mother! It is just like the court of a Sovereign Prince. One is expected to be a complete nonentity, and at the same time give no one any grounds for complaint. 'How I dislike that great girl!' he thought, as he watched Mademoiselle de La Mole cross the room, her mother having called her to introduce her to a number of women visitors. 'She overdoes all the fashions, her gown is falling off her shoulders ... she is even paler than when she went away ... What colourless hair, if that is what they call golden! You would say the light shone through it. How arrogant her way of bowing, of look- ing at people! What regal gestures!' Mademoiselle de La Mole had called her brother back, as he was leav- ing the room. Comte Norbert came up to Julien:

'My dear Sorel,' he began, 'where would you like me to call for you at midnight for M. de Retz's ball? He told me particularly to bring you.' 'I know to whom I am indebted for such kindness,' replied Julien, bowing to the ground. His ill humour, having no fault to find with the tone of politeness, in- deed of personal interest, in which Norbert had addressed him, vented itself upon the reply which he himself had made to this friendly speech. He detected a trace of servility in it. That night, on arriving at the ball, he was struck by the magnificence of the Hotel de Retz. The courtyard was covered with an immense crim- son awning patterned with golden stars: nothing could have been more elegant. Beneath this awning, the court was transformed into a grove of orange trees and oleanders in blossom. As their tubs had been carefully buried at a sufficient depth, these oleanders and orange trees seemed to be springing from the ground. The carriage drive had been sprinkled with sand. The general effect seemed extraordinary to our provincial. He had no idea that such magnificence could exist; in an instant his imagination had taken wings and flown a thousand leagues away from ill humour. In the carriage, on their way to the ball, Norbert had been happy, and he had seen everything in dark colours; as soon as they entered the courtyard their moods were reversed. Norbert was conscious only of certain details, which, in the midst of all this magnificence, had been overlooked. He reckoned up the cost of everything, and as he arrived at a high total, Julien remarked that he ap- peared almost jealous of the outlay and began to sulk. As for Julien, he arrived spell-bound with admiration, and almost tim- id with excess of emotion in the first of the saloons in which the com- pany were dancing. Everyone was making for the door of the second room, and the throng was so great that he found it impossible to move. This great saloon was decorated to represent the Alhambra of Granada. 'She is the belle of the ball, no doubt about it,' said a young man with moustaches, whose shoulder dug into Julien's chest. 'Mademoiselle Fourmont, who has been the reigning beauty all winter,' his companion rejoined, 'sees that she must now take the second place: look how strangely she is frowning.' 'Indeed she is hoisting all her canvas to attract. Look, look at that gra- cious smile as soon as she steps into the middle in that country dance. It is inimitable, upon my honour.'

'Mademoiselle de La Mole has the air of being in full control of the pleasure she derives from her triumph, of which she is very well aware. One would say that she was afraid of attracting whoever speaks to her.' 'Precisely! That is the art of seduction.' Julien was making vain efforts to catch a glimpse of this seductive wo- man; seven or eight men taller than himself prevented him from seeing her. 'There is a good deal of coquetry in that noble reserve,' went on the young man with the moustaches. 'And those big blue eyes which droop so slowly just at the moment when one would say they were going to give her away,' his companion added. 'Faith, she's a past master.' 'Look how common the fair Fourmont appears beside her,' said a third. 'That air of reserve is as much as to say: "How charming I should make myself to you, if you were the man that was worthy of me."' 'And who could be worthy of the sublime Mathilde?' said the first: 'Some reigning Prince, handsome, clever, well made, a hero in battle, and aged twenty at the most.' 'The natural son of the Emperor of Russia, for whom, on the occasion of such a marriage, a Kingdom would be created; or simply the Comte de Thaler, with his air of a peasant in his Sunday clothes ... ' The passage was now cleared, Julien was free to enter. 'Since she appears so remarkable in the eyes of these puppets, it is worth my while to study her,' he thought. 'I shall understand what per- fection means to these people.' As he was trying to catch her eye, Mathilde looked at him. 'Duty calls me,' Julien said to himself, but his resentment was now confined to his expression. Curiosity made him step forward with a pleasure which the low cut of the gown on Mathilda's shoulders rapidly enhanced, in a manner, it must be admitted, by no means flattering to his self-esteem. 'Her beauty has the charm of youth,' he thought. Five or six young men, among whom Julien recognised those whom he had heard talking in the doorway, stood between her and him. 'You can tell me, Sir, as you have been here all the winter,' she said to him, 'is it not true that this is the prettiest ball of the season?' He made no answer. 'This Coulon quadrille seems to me admirable; and the ladies are dan- cing it quite perfectly.' The young men turned round to see who the

fortunate person was who was being thus pressed for an answer. It was not encouraging. 'I should hardly be a good judge, Mademoiselle; I spend my time writ- ing: this is the first ball on such a scale that I have seen.' The moustached young men were shocked. 'You are a sage, Monsieur Sorel,' she went on with a more marked in- terest; 'you look upon all these balls, all these parties, like a philosopher, like a Jean-Jacques Rousseau. These follies surprise you without tempt- ing you.' A chance word had stifled Julien's imagination and banished every il- lusion from his heart. His lips assumed an expression of disdain that was perhaps slightly exaggerated. 'Jean-Jacques Rousseau,' he replied, 'is nothing but a fool in my eyes when he takes it upon himself to criticise society; he did not understand it, and approached it with the heart of an upstart flunkey.' 'He wrote the Contrat Social,' said Mathilde in a tone of veneration. 'For all his preaching a Republic and the overthrow of monarchical titles, the upstart is mad with joy if a Duke alters the course of his after- dinner stroll to accompany one of his friends.' 'Ah, yes! The Due de Luxembourg at Montmorency accompanies a M. Coindet on the road to Paris,' replied Mademoiselle de La Mole with the impetuous delight of a first enjoyment of pedantry. She was overjoyed at her own learning, almost like the Academician who discovered the exist- ence of King Feretrius. Julien's eye remained penetrating and stern. Mathilde had felt a momentary enthusiasm; her partner's coldness dis- concerted her profoundly. She was all the more astonished inasmuch as it was she who was in the habit of producing this effect upon other people. At that moment, the Marquis de Croisenois advanced eagerly towards Mademoiselle de La Mole. He stopped for a moment within a few feet of her, unable to approach her on account of the crowd. He looked at her, with a smile at the obstacle. The young Marquise de Rouvray was close beside him; she was a cousin of Mathilde. She gave her arm to her hus- band, who had been married for only a fortnight. The Marquis de Rouv- ray, who was quite young also, showed all that fatuous love which seizes a man, who having made a 'suitable' marriage entirely arranged by the family lawyers, finds that he has a perfectly charming spouse. M. de Rouvray would be a Duke on the death of an uncle of advanced years. While the Marquis de Croisenois, unable to penetrate the throng, stood gazing at Mathilde with a smiling air, she allowed her large, sky-

blue eyes to rest upon him and his neighbours. 'What could be duller,' she said to herself, 'than all that group! Look at Croisenois who hopes to marry me; he is nice and polite, he has perfect manners like M. de Rouv- ray. If they did not bore me, these gentlemen would be quite charming. He, too, will come to balls with me with that smug, satisfied air. A year after we are married, my carriage, my horses, my gowns, my country house twenty leagues from Paris, everything will be as perfect as pos- sible, just what is needed to make an upstart burst with envy, a Comtesse de Roiville for instance; and after that? Mathilde let her mind drift into the future. The Marquis de Croisenois succeeded in reaching her, and spoke to her, but she dreamed on without listening. The sound of his voice was lost in the hubbub of the ball. Her eye mechanically followed Julien, who had moved away with a respectful, but proud and discontented air. She saw in a corner, aloof from the moving crowd, Conte Altamira, who was under sentence of death in his own country, as the reader already knows. Under Louis XIV, a lady of his family had married a Prince de Conti; this antecedent pro- tected him to some extent from the police of the Congregation. 'I can see nothing but a sentence of death that distinguishes a man,' thought Mathilde: 'it is the only thing that is not to be bought. 'Ah! There is a witty saying that I have wasted on myself! What a pity that it did not occur to me when I could have made the most of it!' Math- ilde had too much taste to lead up in conversation to a witticism pre- pared beforehand; but she had also too much vanity not to be delighted with her own wit. An air of happiness succeeded the appearance of bore- dom in her face. The Marquis de Croisenois, who was still addressing her, thought he saw a chance of success, and doubled his loquacity. 'What fault would anyone have to find with my remark?' Mathilde asked herself. 'I should answer my critic: "A title of Baron, or Viscount, that can be bought; a Cross, that is given; my brother has just had one, what has he ever done? A step in promotion, that is obtained. Ten years of garrison duty, or a relative as Minister for War, and one becomes a squadron-commander, like Norbert. A great fortune! That is still the most difficult thing to secure, and therefore the most meritorious. Now is not that odd? It is just the opposite to what all the books say ... Well, to secure a fortune, one marries M. Rothschild's daughter." 'My remark is really subtle. A death sentence is still the only thing for which no one has ever thought of asking. 'Do you know Conte Altamira?' she asked M. de Croisenois.

She had the air of having come back to earth from so remote an ab- straction, and this question bore so little relation to all that the poor Mar- quis had been saying to her for the last five minutes, that his friendly feelings were somewhat disconcerted. He was, however, a man of ready wit, and highly esteemed in that capacity. 'Mathilde is certainly odd,' he thought; 'it is a drawback, but she gives her husband such a splendid social position! I cannot think how the Mar- quis de La Mole manages it; he is on intimate terms with the best people in every party, he is a man who cannot fall. Besides, this oddity in Math- ilde may pass for genius. Given noble birth and an ample fortune, genius is not to be laughed at, and then, what distinction! She has such a com- mand, too, when she pleases, of that combination of wit, character and aptness, which makes conversation perfect... ' As it is hard to do two things well at the same time, the Marquis answered Mathilde with a va- cant air, and as though repeating a lesson: 'Who does not know poor Altamira?' and he told her the story of the absurd, abortive conspiracy. 'Most absurd!' said Mathilde, as though speaking to herself, 'but he has done something. I wish to see a man; bring him to me,' she said to the Marquis, who was deeply shocked. Conte Altamira was one of the most openly professed admirers of the haughty and almost impertinent air of Mademoiselle de La Mole; she was, according to him, one of the loveliest creatures in Paris. 'How beautiful she would be on a throne!' he said to M. de Croisenois, and made no difficulty about allowing himself to be led to her. There are not wanting in society people who seek to establish the prin- ciple that nothing is in such bad tone as a conspiracy; it reeks of Jacobin- ism. And what can be more vile than an unsuccessful Jacobin? Mathilde's glance derided Altamira's Liberalism to M. de Croisenois, but she listened to him with pleasure. 'A conspirator at a ball, it is a charming contrast,' she thought. In this conspirator, with his black moustaches, she detected a resemblance to a lion in repose; but she soon found that his mind had but one attitude: utility, admiration for utility. Excepting only what might bring to his country Two Chamber govern- ment, the young Count felt that nothing was worthy of his attention. He parted from Mathilde, the most attractive person at the ball, with pleas- ure because he had seen a Peruvian General enter the room. Despairing of Europe, poor Altamira had been reduced to hoping that, when the States of South America became strong and powerful, they

might restore to Europe the freedom which Mirabeau had sent to them. 10 A swarm of young men with moustaches had gathered round Math- ilde. She had seen quite well that Altamira was not attracted, and felt piqued by his desertion of her; she saw his dark eye gleam as he spoke to the Peruvian General. Mademoiselle de La Mole studied the young Frenchmen with that profound seriousness which none of her rivals was able to imitate. 'Which of them,' she thought, 'could ever be sentenced to death, even allowing him the most favourable conditions?' This singular gaze flattered those who had little intelligence, but dis- turbed the rest. They feared the explosion of some pointed witticism which it would be difficult to answer. 'Good birth gives a man a hundred qualities the absence of which would offend me: I see that in Julien's case,' thought Mathilde; 'but it destroys those qualities of the spirit which make people be sentenced to death.' At that moment someone remarked in her hearing: 'That Conte Altamira is the second son of the Principe di San Nazaro-Pimentel; it was a Pimentel who attempted to save Conradin, beheaded in 1268. They are one of the noblest families of Naples.' 'There,' Mathilde said to herself, 'is an excellent proof of my maxim: Good birth destroys the strength of character without which people do not incur sentences of death. I seem fated to go wrong this evening. Since I am only a woman like any other, well, I must dance.' She yielded to the persistence of the Marquis de Croisenois, who for the last hour had been pleading for a galop. To distract her thoughts from her philosophical failure, Mathilde chose to be perfectly bewitching; M. de Croisenois was in ecstasies. But not the dance, nor the desire to please one of the handsomest men at court, nothing could distract Mathilde. She could not possibly have enjoyed a greater triumph. She was the queen of the ball, she knew it, but she remained cold. 'What a colourless life I shall lead with a creature like Croisenois,' she said to herself, as he led her back to her place an hour later ... 'What pleasure can there be for me,' she went on sadly, 'if after an absence of six months, I do not find any in a ball which is the envy of all the women 10.This page, written on July 25, 1830, was printed on August 4.

in Paris? And moreover I am surrounded by the homage of a society which could not conceivably be more select. There is no plebeian ele- ment here except a few peers and a Julien or two perhaps. And yet,' she added, with a growing melancholy, 'what advantages has not fate be- stowed on me! Birth, wealth, youth! Everything, alas, but happiness. 'The most dubious of my advantages are those of which they have been telling me all evening. Wit, I know I have, for obviously I frighten them all. If they venture to broach a serious subject, after five minutes of conversation they all arrive out of breath, and as though making a great discovery, at something which I have been repeating to them for the last hour. I am beautiful, I have that advantage for which Madame de Stael would have sacrificed everything, and yet the fact remains that I am dy- ing of boredom. Is there any reason why I should be less bored when I have changed my name to that of the Marquis de Croisenois? 'But, Lord!' she added, almost in tears, 'is he not a perfect man? He is the masterpiece of the education of the age; one cannot look at him without his thinking of something pleasant, and even clever, to say to one; he is brave ... But that Sorel is a strange fellow,' she said to herself, and the look of gloom in her eye gave place to a look of anger. 'I told him that I had something to say to him, and he does not condescend to return!'

Chapter The Ball The splendour of the dresses, the blaze of the candles, the per- fumes; all those rounded arms, and fine shoulders; bouquets, the sound of Rossini's music, pictures by Ciceri! I am beside myself! Travels of Uzeri 'You are feeling cross,' the Marquise de La Mole said to her; 'I warn you, that is not good manners at a ball.' 'It is only a headache,' replied Mathilde contemptuously, 'it is too hot in here.' At that moment, as though to corroborate Mademoiselle de La Mole, the old Baron de Tolly fainted and fell to the ground; he had to be carried out. There was talk of apoplexy, it was a disagreeable incident. Mathilde did not give it a thought. It was one of her definite habits never to look at an old man or at anyone known to be given to talking about sad things. She danced to escape the conversation about the apoplexy, which was nothing of the sort, for a day or two later the Baron reappeared. 'But M. Sorel does not appear,' she said to herself again after she had finished dancing. She was almost searching for him with her eyes when she caught sight of him in another room. Strange to say, he seemed to have shed the tone of impassive coldness which was so natural to him; he had no longer the air of an Englishman. 'He is talking to Conte Altamira, my condemned man!' Mathilde said to herself. 'His eye is ablaze with a sombre fire; he has the air of a Prince in disguise; the arrogance of his gaze has increased.' Julien was coming towards the spot where she was, still talking to Altamira; she looked fixedly at him, studying his features in search of those lofty qualities which may entitle a man to the honour of being sen- tenced to death. As he passed by her: 'Yes,' he was saying to Conte Altamira, 'Danton was a man!'

'Oh, heavens! Is he to be another Danton,' thought Mathilde; 'but he has such a noble face, and that Danton was so horribly ugly, a butcher, I fancy.' Julien was still quite near her, she had no hesitation in calling to him; she was conscious and proud of asking a question that was ex- traordinary, coming from a girl. 'Was not Danton a butcher?' she asked him. 'Yes, in the eyes of certain people,' Julien answered her with an expres- sion of the most ill-concealed scorn, his eye still ablaze from his conver- sation with Altamira, 'but unfortunately for people of birth, he was a lawyer at Mery-sur-Seine; that is to say, Mademoiselle,' he went on with an air of sarcasm, 'that he began life like several of the Peers whom I see here this evening. It is true that Danton had an enormous disadvantage in the eyes of beauty: he was extremely ugly.' The last words were uttered rapidly, with an extraordinary and cer- tainly far from courteous air. Julien waited for a moment, bowing slightly from the waist and with an arrogantly humble air. He seemed to be saying: 'I am paid to answer you, and I live upon my pay.' He did not deign to raise his eyes to her face. She, with her fine eyes opened extraordinarily wide and fastened upon him, seemed like his slave. At length, as the silence continued, he looked at her as a servant looks at his master, when receiving orders. Al- though his eyes looked full into those of Mathilde, still fastened upon him with a strange gaze, he withdrew with marked alacrity. 'That he, who really is so handsome,' Mathilde said to herself at length, awakening from her dreams, 'should pay such a tribute to ugliness! Never a thought of himself! He is not like Caylus or Croisenois. This Sorel has something of the air my father adopts when he is playing the Napoleon, at a ball.' She had entirely forgotten Danton. 'No doubt about it, I am bored this evening.' She seized her brother by the arm, and, greatly to his disgust, forced him to take her for a tour of the rooms. The idea occurred to her of following the condemned man's conversation with Julien. The crowd was immense. She succeeded, however, in overtaking them at the moment when, just in front of her, Altamira had stopped by a tray of ices to help himself. He was talking to Julien, half turning towards him. He saw an arm in a braided sleeve stretched out to take an ice from the same tray. The gold lace seemed to attract his attention; he turned round bodily to see whose this arm was. Immediately his eyes, so noble and unaffected, assumed a slight expression of scorn.

'You see that man,' he murmured to Julien; 'he is the Principe d'Araceli, the —— Ambassador. This morning he applied for my extradi- tion to your French Foreign Minister, M. de Nerval. Look, there he is over there, playing whist. M. de Nerval is quite ready to give me up, for we gave you back two or three conspirators in 1816. If they surrender me to my King I shall be hanged within twenty-four hours. And it will be one of those pretty gentlemen with moustaches who will seize me.' 'The wretches!' exclaimed Julien, half aloud. Mathilde did not lose a syllable of their conversation. Her boredom had vanished. 'Not such wretches as all that,' replied Conte Altamira. 'I have spoken to you of myself to impress you with a real instance. Look at Principe d'Araceli; every five minutes he casts a glance at his Golden Fleece; he cannot get over the pleasure of seeing that trinket on his breast. The poor man is really nothing worse than an anachronism. A hundred years ago, the Golden Fleece was a signal honour, but then it would have been far above his head. Today, among people of breeding, one must be an Araceli to be thrilled by it. He would have hanged a whole town to ob- tain it.' 'Was that the price he paid for it?' said Julien, with anxiety. 'Not exactly,' replied Altamira coldly; 'he perhaps had some thirty wealthy landowners of his country, who were supposed to be Liberals, flung into the river.' 'What a monster!' said Julien again. Mademoiselle de La Mole, leaning forward with the keenest interest, was so close to him that her beautiful hair almost brushed his shoulder. 'You are very young!' replied Altamira. 'I told you that I have a mar- ried sister in Provence; she is still pretty, good, gentle; she is an excellent mother, faithful to all her duties, pious without bigotry.' 'What is he leading up to?' thought Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'She is happy,' Conte Altamira continued; 'she was happy in 1815. At that time I was in hiding there, on her property near Antibes; well, as soon as she heard of the execution of Marshal Ney, she began to dance!' 'Is it possible?' said the horrified Julien. 'It is the partisan spirit,' replied Altamira. There are no longer any genuine passions in the nineteenth century; that is why people are so bored in France. We commit the greatest cruelties, but without cruelty.' 'All the worse!' said Julien; 'at least, when we commit crimes, we should commit them with pleasure: that is the only good thing about them, and the only excuse that can in any way justify them.'

Mademoiselle de La Mole, entirely forgetting what she owed to her- self, had placed herself almost bodily between Altamira and Julien. Her brother, upon whose arm she leaned, being accustomed to obey her, was looking about the room, and, to hide his lack of composure, pretending to be held up by the crowd. 'You are right,' said Altamira; 'we do everything without pleasure and without remembering it afterwards, even our crimes. I can point out to you at this ball ten men, perhaps, who will be damned as murderers. They have forgotten it, and the world also. 11 'Many of them are moved to tears if their dog breaks its paw. At Pere- Lachaise, when people strew flowers on their graves, as you so charm- ingly say in Paris, we are told that they combined all the virtues of the knights of old, and we hear of the great deeds of their ancestor who lived in the days of Henri IV: If, despite the good offices of Principe d'Araceli, I am not hanged, and if I ever come to enjoy my fortune in Paris, I hope to invite you to dine with nine or ten murderers who are honoured and feel no remorse. 'You and I, at that dinner, will be the only two whose hands are free from blood, but I shall be despised and almost hated, as a bloody and Ja- cobinical monster, and you will simply be despised as a plebeian who has thrust his way into good society.' 'Nothing could be more true,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole. Altamira looked at her in astonishment; Julien did not deign to look at her. 'Note that the revolution at the head of which I found myself,' Conte Altamira went on, 'was unsuccessful, solely because I would not cut off three heads, and distribute among our supporters seven or eight millions which happened to be in a safe of which I held the key. My King, who is now burning to have me hanged, and who, before the revolt, used to ad- dress me as tu, would have given me the Grand Cordon of his Order if I had cut off those three heads and distributed the money in those safes: for then I should have scored at least a partial success, and my country would have had a Charter of sorts ... Such is the way of the world, it is a game of chess.' 'Then,' replied Julien, his eyes ablaze, 'you did not know the game; now ... ' 'I should cut off the heads, you mean, and I should not be a Girondin as you gave me to understand the other day? I will answer you,' said 11.'A malcontent is speaking.' (Note by Moliere to Tartuffe.)

Altamira sadly, 'when you have killed a man in a duel, and that is a great deal less unpleasant than having him put to death by a headsman.' 'Faith!' said Julien, 'the end justifies the means; if, instead of being a mere atom, I had any power, I would hang three men to save the lives of four.' His eyes expressed the fire of conscience and a contempt for the vain judgments of men; they met those of Mademoiselle de La Mole who stood close beside him, and this contempt, instead of changing into an air of gracious civility, seemed to intensify. It shocked her profoundly; but it no longer lay in her power to forget Julien; she moved indifferently away, taking her brother with her. 'I must take some punch, and dance a great deal,' she said to herself, 'I intend to take the best that is going, and to create an effect at all costs. Good, here comes that master of impertinence, the Comte de Fervaques.' She accepted his invitation; they danced. 'It remains to be seen,' she thought, 'which of us will be the more impertinent, but, to get the full en- joyment out of him, I must make him talk.' Presently all the rest of the country dance became a pure formality. No one was willing to miss any of Mathilde's piquant repartees. M. de Fervaques grew troubled, and, be- ing able to think of nothing but elegant phrases, in place of ideas, began to smirk; Mathilde, who was out of temper, treated him cruelly, and made an enemy of him. She danced until daybreak, and finally went home horribly tired. But, in the carriage, the little strength that remained to her was still employed in making her melancholy and wretched. She had been scorned by Julien, and was unable to scorn him. Julien was on a pinnacle of happiness. Carried away unconsciously by the music, the flowers, the beautiful women, the general elegance, and, most of all, by his own imagination, which dreamed of distinctions for himself and of liberty for mankind: 'What a fine ball!' he said to the Conte, 'nothing is lacking.' 'Thought is lacking,' replied Altamira. And his features betrayed that contempt which is all the more striking because one sees that politeness makes it a duty to conceal it. 'You are here, Monsieur le Comte. Is not that thought, and actively conspiring, too?' 'I am here because of my name. But they hate thought in your drawing-rooms. It must never rise above the level of a comic song: then it is rewarded. But the man who thinks, if he shows energy and novelty in his sallies, you call a cynic. Is not that the name that one of your judges bestowed upon Courier? You put him in prison, and Beranger also.

Everything that is of any value among you, intellectually, the Congrega- tion flings to the criminal police; and society applauds. 'The truth is that your antiquated society values conventionality above everything ... You will never rise higher than martial gallantry; you will have Murats, but never a Washington. I can see nothing in France but vanity. A man who thinks of things as he speaks may easily say something rash, and his host then imagines himself insulted.' At this point, the Conte's carriage, which was taking Julien home, stopped at the Hotel de La Mole. Julien was in love with his conspirator. Altamira had paid him a handsome compliment, evidently springing from a profound conviction: 'You have not the French frivolity, and you understand the principle of utility.' It so happened that, only two even- ings before, Julien had seen Marino Faliero, a tragedy by M. Casimir Delavigne. 'Has not Israel Bertuccio more character than all those Venetian nobles?' our rebellious plebeian asked himself; 'and yet they are men whose noble descent can be proved as far back as the year 700, a century before Charlemagne; whereas the bluest blood at M. de Retz's ball to- night does not go farther back, and that only by a hop, skip and jump, than the thirteenth century. Very well! Among those Venetian nobles, so great by birth, it is Israel Bertuccio that one remembers. 'A conspiracy wipes out all the titles conferred by social caprice. In those conditions, a man springs at once to the rank which his manner of facing death assigns to him. The mind itself loses some of its authority ... 'What would Danton be today, in this age of Valenods and Renais? Not even a Deputy Crown Prosecutor ... 'What am I saying? He would have sold himself to the Congregation; he would be a Minister, for after all the great Danton did steal. Mirabeau, too, sold himself. Napoleon stole millions in Italy, otherwise he would have been brought to a standstill by poverty, like Pichegru. Only La Fay- ette never stole. Must one steal, must one sell oneself?' Julien wondered. The question arrested the flow of his imagination. He spent the rest of the night reading the history of the Revolution. Next day, as he copied his letters in the library, he could still think of nothing but Conte Altamira's conversation. 'It is quite true,' he said to himself, after a long spell of absorption; 'if those Spanish Liberals had compromised the people by a few crimes, they would not have been swept away so easily. They were conceited, chattering boys ... like myself!' Julien suddenly cried, as though awaking with a bound.

'What difficult thing have I ever done that gives me the right to judge poor devils who, after all, once in their lives, have dared, have begun to act? I am like a man who, on rising from table, exclaims: "Tomorrow I shall not dine; that will not prevent me from feeling strong and brisk as I do today." How can I tell what people feel in the middle of a great ac- tion? ... ' These lofty thoughts were interrupted by the sudden arrival of Mademoiselle de La Mole, who at this moment entered the library. He was so excited by his admiration for the great qualities of Danton, Mira- beau, Carnot, who had contrived not to be crushed, that his eyes rested upon Mademoiselle de La Mole, but without his thinking of her, without his greeting her, almost without his seeing her. When at length his great staring eyes became aware of her presence, the light died out in them. Mademoiselle de La Mole remarked this with a feeling of bitterness. In vain did she ask him for a volume of Vely's Histoire de France which stood on the highest shelf, so that Julien was obliged to fetch the longer of the two ladders. He brought the ladder; he found the volume, he handed it to her, still without being able to think of her. As he carried back the ladder, in his preoccupation, his elbow struck one of the glass panes protecting the shelves; the sound of the splinters falling on the floor at length aroused him. He hastened to make his apology to Ma- demoiselle de La Mole; he tried to be polite, but he was nothing more. Mathilde saw quite plainly that she had disturbed him, that he would have preferred to dream of what had been occupying his mind before her entry, rather than to talk to her. After a long glance at him, she slowly left the room. Julien watched her as she went. He enjoyed the contrast between the simplicity of the attire she was now wearing and her sumptuous magnificence overnight. The difference in her physiognomy was hardly less striking. This girl, so haughty at the Duc de Retz's ball, had at this moment almost a suppliant look. 'Really,' Julien told himself, 'that black gown shows off the beauty of her figure better than anything; but why is she in mourning? 'If I ask anyone the reason of this mourning, I shall only make myself appear a fool as usual.' Julien had quite come to earth from the soaring flight of his enthusiasm. 'I must read over all the letters I have written today; Heaven knows how many missing words and blunders I shall find.' As he was reading with forced attention the first of these letters, he heard close beside him the rustle of a silken gown; he turned sharply round; Mademoiselle de La Mole was standing by his table, and smiling. This second interruption made Julien lose his temper.

As for Mathilde, she had just become vividly aware that she meant nothing to this young man; her smile was intended to cover her embar- rassment, and proved successful. 'Evidently, you are thinking about something that is extremely inter- esting, Monsieur Sorel. Is it by any chance some curious anecdote of the conspiracy that has sent the Conte Altamira here to Paris? Tell me what it is? I am burning to know; I shall be discreet, I swear to you!' This last sentence astonished her as she uttered it. What, she was pleading with a subordinate! Her embarrassment grew, she adopted a light manner: 'What can suddenly have turned you, who are ordinarily so cold, into an inspired creature, a sort of Michelangelo prophet?' This bold and indiscreet question, cutting Julien to the quick, revived all his passion. 'Was Danton justified in stealing?' he said to her sharply, and with an air that grew more and more savage. 'The Revolutionaries of Piedmont, of Spain, ought they to have compromised the people by crimes? To have given away, even to men without merit, all the commands in the army, all the Crosses? Would not the men who wore those Crosses have had reason to fear a Restoration of their King? Ought they to have let the Treasury in Turin be pillaged? In a word, Mademoiselle,' he said, as he came towards her with a terrible air, 'ought the man who seeks to banish ignorance and crime from the earth to pass like a whirlwind and do evil as though blindly?' Mathilde was afraid, she could not meet his gaze, and recoiled a little. She looked at him for a moment; then, ashamed of her fear, with a light step left the library.

Chapter Queen Marguerite Love! In what folly do you not contrive to make us find pleasure? Letters of a Portuguese Nun Julien read over his letters. When the dinner bell sounded: 'How ri- diculous I must have appeared in the eyes of that Parisian doll!' he said to himself; 'what madness to tell her what was really in my thoughts! And yet perhaps not so very mad. The truth on this occasion was worthy of me. 'Why, too, come and cross-examine me on private matters? Her ques- tion was indiscreet. She forgot herself. My thoughts on Danton form no part of the sacrifice for which her father pays me.' On reaching the dining-room, Julien was distracted from his ill hu- mour by Mademoiselle de La Mole's deep mourning, which was all the more striking since none of the rest of the family was in black. After dinner, he found himself entirely recovered from the fit of enthu- siasm which had possessed him all day. Fortunately, the Academician who knew Latin was present at dinner. There is the man who will be least contemptuous of me, if, as I suppose, my question about Ma- demoiselle de La Mole's mourning should prove a blunder.' Mathilde was looking at him with a singular expression. 'There we have an instance of the coquetry of the women of these parts, just as Ma- dame de Renal described it to me,' Julien told himself. 'I was not agree- able to her this morning, I did not yield to her impulse for conversation. My value has increased in her eyes. No doubt the devil loses no oppor- tunity there. Later on, her proud scorn will find out a way of avenging it- self. Let her do her worst. How different from the woman I have lost! What natural charm! What simplicity! I knew what was in her mind be- fore she did; I could see her thoughts take shape; I had no competitor, in her heart, but the fear of losing her children; it was a reasonable and nat- ural affection, indeed it was pleasant for me who felt the same fear. I was

a fool. The ideas that I had I formed of Paris prevented me from appreci- ating that sublime woman. 'What a difference, great God! And what do I find here? A sere and haughty vanity, all the refinements of self-esteem and nothing more.' The party left the table. 'I must not let my Academician be intercepted,' said Julien. He went up to him as they were moving into the garden, as- sumed a meek, submissive air, and sympathised with his rage at the suc- cess of Hernani. 'If only we lived in the days of lettres de cachet!' he said. 'Ah, then he would never have dared,' cried the Academician, with a gesture worthy of Talma. In speaking of a flower, Julien quoted a line or two from Virgil's Geor- gics, and decided that nothing came up to the poetry of the abbe Delille. In short, he flattered the Academician in every possible way. After which, with an air of the utmost indifference: 'I suppose,' he said to him, 'that Mademoiselle de La Mole has received a legacy from some uncle for whom she is in mourning.' 'What! You live in the house,' said the Academician, coming to a standstill, 'and you don't know her mania? Indeed, it is strange that her mother allows such things; but, between you and me, it is not exactly by strength of character that they shine in this family. Mademoiselle Math- ilde has enough for them all, and leads them by the nose. Today is the 3Oth of April!' and the Academician broke off, looking at Julien, with an air of connivance. Julien smiled as intelligently as he was able. 'What connection can there be between leading a whole household by the nose, wearing black and the 30th of April?' he asked himself. 'I must be even stupider than I thought. 'I must confess to you,' he said to the Academician, and his eye contin- ued the question. 'Let us take a turn in the garden,' said the Academician, delighted to see this chance of delivering a long and formal speech. 'What! Is it really possible that you do not know what happened on the 30th of April, 1574?' 'Where?' asked Julien, in surprise. 'On the Place de Greve.' Julien was so surprised that this name did not enlighten him. His curi- osity, the prospect of a tragic interest, so attuned to his nature, gave him those sparkling eyes which a story-teller so loves to see in his audience. The Academician, delighted to find a virgin ear, related at full length to Julien how, on the 30th of April, 1574, the handsomest young man of his

age, Boniface de La Mole, and Annibal de Coconasso, a Piedmontese gentleman, his friend, had been beheaded on the Place de Greve. 'La Mole was the adored lover of Queen Marguerite of Navarre; and ob- serve,' the Academician added, 'that Mademoiselle de La Mole is named Mathilde-Marguerite. La Mole was at the same time the favourite of the Duc d'Alencon and an intimate friend of the King of Navarre, afterwards Henri IV, the husband of his mistress. On Shrove Tuesday in this year, 1574, the Court happened to be at Saint-Germain, with the unfortunate King Charles IX, who was on his deathbed. La Mole wished to carry off the Princes, his friends, whom Queen Catherine de' Medici was keeping as prisoners with the Court. He brought up two hundred horsemen un- der the walls of Saint-Germain, the Due d'Alencon took fright, and La Mole was sent to the scaffold. 'But what appeals to Mademoiselle Mathilde, as she told me herself, seven or eight years ago, when she was only twelve, for she has a head, such a head! ... ' and the Academician raised his eyes to heaven. 'What impresses her in this political catastrophe is that Queen Marguerite of Navarre, who had waited concealed in a house on the Place de Greve, made bold to ask the executioner for her lover's head. And the following night, at midnight, she took the head in her carriage, and went to bury it with her own hands in a chapel which stood at the foot of the hill of Montmartre.' 'Is it possible?' exclaimed Julien, deeply touched. 'Mademoiselle Mathilde despises her brother because, as you see, he thinks nothing of all this ancient history, and never goes into mourning on the 30th of April. It is since this famous execution, and to recall the in- timate friendship between La Mole and Coconasso, which Coconasso, being as he was an Italian, was named Annibal, that all the men of this family have borne that name. And,' the Academician went on, lowering his voice, 'this Coconasso was, on the authority of Charles IX, himself, one of the bloodiest assassins on the 24th of August, 1572.. But how is it possible, my dear Sorel, that you are ignorant of these matters, you, who are an inmate of the house?' 'Then that is why twice, during the dinner, Mademoiselle de La Mole addressed her brother as Annibal. I thought I had not heard aright.' 'It was a reproach. It is strange that the Marquise permits such folly ... That great girl's husband will see some fine doings!' This expression was followed by five or six satirical phrases. The joy at thus revealing an intimate secret that shone in the Academician's eyes shocked Julien. 'What are we but a pair of servants engaged in

slandering our employers?' he thought. 'But nothing ought to surprise me that is done by this academic gentleman.' One day Julien had caught him on his knees before the Marquise de La Mole; he was begging her for a tobacco licence for a nephew in the coun- try. That night, he gathered from a little maid of Mademoiselle de La Mole, who was making love to him, as Elisa had done in the past, that her mistress's mourning was by no means put on to attract attention. This eccentricity was an intimate part of her nature. She really loved this La Mole, the favoured lover of the most brilliant Queen of her age, who had died for having sought to set his friends at liberty. And what friends! The First Prince of the Blood and Henri IV. Accustomed to the perfect naturalness that shone through the whole of Madame de Renal's conduct, Julien saw nothing but affectation in all the women of Paris, and even without feeling disposed to melancholy, could think of nothing to say to them. Mademoiselle de La Mole was the exception. He began no longer to mistake for hardness of heart the kind of beauty that goes with nobility of bearing. He had long conversations with Ma- demoiselle de La Mole, who would stroll with him in the garden some- times after dinner, past the open windows of the drawing-room. She told him one day that she was reading d'Aubigne's History, and Brantome. 'A strange choice,' thought Julien, 'and the Marquise does not allow her to read the novels of Walter Scott!' One day she related to him, with that glow of pleasure in her eyes which proves the sincerity of the speaker's admiration, the feat of a young woman in the reign of Henri in, which she had just discovered in the Memoires by l'Etoile: finding that her husband was unfaithful, she had stabbed him. Julien's self-esteem was flattered. A person surrounded by such defer- ence, one who, according to the Academician, was the leader of the household, deigned to address him in a tone which might almost be re- garded as friendly. 'I was mistaken,' was his next thought; 'this is not fa- miliarity, I am only the listener to a tragic story, it is the need to speak. I am regarded as learned by this family. I shall go and read Brantome, d'Aubigne, l'Etoile. I shall be able to challenge some of the anecdotes which Mademoiselle de La Mole cites to me. I must emerge from this part of a passive listener.' In course of time his conversations with this girl, whose manner was at once so imposing and so easy, became more interesting. He forgot his melancholy role as a plebeian in revolt. He found her learned and indeed

rational. Her opinions in the garden differed widely from those which she maintained in the drawing-room. At times she displayed with him an enthusiasm and a frankness which formed a perfect contrast with her normal manner, so haughty and cold. 'The Wars of the League are the heroic age of France,' she said to him one day, her eyes aflame with intellect and enthusiasm. 'Then everyone fought to secure a definite object which he desired in order to make his party triumph, and not merely to win a stupid Cross as in the days of your Emperor. You must agree that there was less egoism and pettiness. I love that period.' 'And Boniface de La Mole was its hero,' he said to her. 'At any rate he was loved as it is perhaps pleasant to be loved. What woman alive today would not be horrified to touch the head of her de- capitated lover?' Madame de La Mole called her daughter indoors. Hypocrisy, to be ef- fective, must be concealed; and Julien, as we see, had taken Mademois- elle de La Mole partly into his confidence as to his admiration for Napoleon. 'That is the immense advantage which they have over us,' he said to himself, when left alone in the garden. 'The history of their ancestors raises them above vulgar sentiments, and they have not always to be thinking of their daily bread! What a wretched state of things!' he added bitterly. 'I am not worthy to discuss these serious matters. My life is nothing more than a sequence of hypocrisies, because I have not an in- come of a thousand francs with which to buy my bread.' 'What are you dreaming of, Sir?' Mathilde asked him, running back outdoors. Julien was tired of despising himself. In a moment of pride, he told her frankly what he was thinking. He blushed deeply when speaking of his poverty to a person who was so rich. He sought to make it quite clear by his proud tone that he asked for nothing. Never had he seemed so hand- some to Mathilde; she found in him an expression of sensibility and frankness which he often lacked. Less than a month later, Julien was strolling pensively in the garden of the Hotel de La Mole; but his features no longer showed the harshness, as of a surly philosopher, which the constant sense of his own inferiority impressed on them. He had just come from the door of the drawing- room to which he had escorted Mademoiselle de La Mole, who preten- ded that she had hurt her foot when running with her brother.

'She leaned upon my arm in the strangest fashion!' Julien said to him- self. 'Am I a fool, or can it be true that she has a liking for me? She listens to me so meekly even when I confess to her all the sufferings of my pride! She, who is so haughty with everyone else! They would be greatly surprised in the drawing-room if they saw her looking like that. There is no doubt about it, she never assumes that meek, friendly air with anyone but myself.' Julien tried not to exaggerate this singular friendship. He compared it himself to an armed neutrality. Day by day, when they met, before re- suming the almost intimate tone of the day before, they almost asked themselves: 'Are we friends today, or enemies?' Julien had realised that, were he once to allow himself to be insulted with impunity by this haughty girl, all was lost. 'If I must quarrel, is it not to my advantage to do so from the first, in defending the lawful rights of my pride, rather than in repelling the marks of contempt that must quickly follow the slightest surrender of what I owe to my personal dignity?' Several times, on days of mutual discord, Mathilde tried to adopt with him the tone of a great lady; she employed a rare skill in these attempts, but Julien repulsed them rudely. One day he interrupted her suddenly: 'Has Mademoiselle de La Mole some order to give to her father's secretary?' he asked her; 'he is obliged to listen to her orders and to carry them out with respect; but apart from that, he has not one word to say to her. He certainly is not paid to com- municate his thoughts to her.' This state of affairs, and the singular doubts which Julien felt banished the boredom which he found regularly in that drawing-room, in which, for all its magnificence, people were afraid of everything, and it was not thought proper to treat any subject lightly. 'It would be amusing if she loved me! Whether she loves me or not,' Julien went on, 'I have as my intimate confidant an intelligent girl, before whom I see the whole household tremble, and most of all the Marquis de Croisenois. That young man who is so polished, so gentle, so brave, who combines in his own person all the advantages of birth and fortune, any one of which would set my heart so at ease! He is madly in love with her, he is going to marry her. Think of all the letters M. de La Mole has made me write to the two lawyers arranging the contract! And I who see my- self so subordinate, pen in hand, two hours later, here in the garden, I tri- umph over so attractive a young man: for after all, her preference is strik- ing, direct. Perhaps, too, she hates the idea of him as a future husband.

She is proud enough for that. And the favour she shows me, I obtain on the footing of a confidential servant! 'But no, either I am mad, or she is making love to me; the more I show myself cold and respectful towards her, the more she seeks me out. That might be deliberate, an affectation; but I see her eyes become animated when I appear unexpectedly. Are the women of Paris capable of pretend- ing to such an extent? What does it matter! I have appearances on my side, let us make the most of them. My God, how handsome she is! How I admire her great blue eyes, seen at close range, and looking at me as they often do! What a difference between this spring and the last, when I was living in misery, keeping myself alive by my strength of character, surrounded by those three hundred dirty and evil-minded hypocrites! I was almost as evil as they.' In moments of depression: That girl is making a fool of me,' Julien would think. 'She is plotting with her brother to mystify me. But she seems so to despise her brother's want of energy! He is brave, and there is no more to be said, she tells me. He has not an idea which ventures to depart from the fashion. It is always I who am obliged to take up her de- fence. A girl of nineteen! At that age can a girl be faithful at every mo- ment of the day to the code of hypocrisy that she has laid down for herself? 'On the other hand, when Mademoiselle de La Mole fastens her great blue eyes on me with a certain strange expression, Comte Norbert al- ways moves away. That seems to me suspicious; ought he not to be an- noyed at his sister's singling out a domestic of their household? For I have heard the Duc de Chaulnes use that term of me.' At this memory anger obliterated every other feeling. 'Is it only the love of old-fashioned speech in that ducal maniac? 'Anyhow, she is pretty!' Julien went on, with the glare of a tiger. 'I will have her, I shall then depart and woe to him that impedes me in my flight!' This plan became Julien's sole occupation; he could no longer give a thought to anything else. His days passed like hours. At all hours of the day, when he sought to occupy his mind with some serious business, his thoughts would abandon everything, and he would come to himself a quarter of an hour later, his heart throbbing, his head confused, and dreaming of this one idea: 'Does she love me?'

Chapter The Tyranny of a Girl I admire her beauty, but I fear her intelligence. MERIMEE Had Julien devoted to the consideration of what went on in the drawing-room the time which he spent in exaggerating Mathilde's beauty, or in lashing himself into a fury at the aloofness natural to her family, whom she was forgetting in his company, he would have under- stood in what her despotic power over everyone round about her con- sisted. Whenever anyone earned Mademoiselle de La Mole's displeasure, she knew how to punish him by a witticism so calculated, so well chosen, apparently so harmless, so aptly launched, that the wound it left deepened the more he thought of it. In time she became deadly to wounded vanity. As she attached no importance to many things that were the object of serious ambition with the rest of her family, she al- ways appeared cool in their eyes. The drawing-rooms of the nobility are pleasant things to mention after one has left them, but that is all; bare po- liteness is something in itself only for the first few days. Julien experi- enced this; after the first enchantment, the first bewilderment. 'Politeness,' he said to himself, 'is nothing more than the absence of the irritation which would come from bad manners.' Mathilde was fre- quently bored, perhaps she would have been bored in any circum- stances. At such times to sharpen the point of an epigram was for her a distraction and a real pleasure. It was perhaps in order to have victims slightly more amusing than her distinguished relatives, the Academician and the five or six other in- feriors who formed their court, that she had given grounds for hope to the Marquis de Croisenois, the Comte de Caylus and two or three other young men of the highest distinction. They were nothing more to her than fresh subjects for epigram. We confess with sorrow, for we are fond of Mathilde, that she had re- ceived letters from several of their number, and had occasionally

answered them. We hasten to add that this character in our story forms an exception to the habits of the age. It is not, generally speaking, with want of prudence that one can reproach the pupils of the noble Convent of the Sacre-Coeur. One day the Marquis de Croisenois returned to Mathilde a distinctly compromising letter which she had written him the day before. He thought that by this sign of extreme prudence he was greatly strengthen- ing his position. But imprudence was what Mathilde enjoyed in her cor- respondence. It was her chief pleasure to play with fire. She did not speak to him again for six weeks. She amused herself with the letters of these young men; but, according to her, they were all alike. It was always the most profound, the most melancholy passion. 'They are all the same perfect gentlemen, ready to set off for Palestine,' she said to her cousin. 'Can you think of anything more insipid? Think that this is the sort of letter that I am going to receive for the rest of my life! These letters can only change every twenty years, according to the kind of occupation that is in fashion. They must have been less colourless in the days of the Empire. Then all these young men in society had seen or performed actions in which there was real greatness. The Due de N——, my uncle, fought at Wagram.' 'What intelligence is required to wield a sabre? And when that has happened to them, they talk about it so often!' said Mademoiselle de Sainte-Heredite, Mathilde's cousin. 'Oh, well, those stories amuse me. To have been in a real battle, one of Napoleon's battles, in which ten thousand soldiers were killed, is a proof of courage. Exposing oneself to danger elevates the soul, and saves it from the boredom in which all my poor adorers seem to be plunged; and it is contagious, that boredom. Which of them ever dreams of doing any- thing out of the common? They seek to win my hand, a fine enterprise! I am rich, and my father will help on his son-in-law. Oh, if only he could find one who was at all amusing!' Mathilde's vivid, picturesque point of view affected her speech, as we can see. Often something she said jarred on the refined nerves of her highly polished friends. They would almost have admitted, had she been less in the fashion, that there was something in her language a little too highly coloured for feminine delicacy. She, on her part, was most unjust to the handsome men on horseback who throng the Bois de Boulogne. She looked towards the future, not

with terror, that would have been too strong a feeling, but with a disgust very rare at her age. What had she left to desire? Fortune, noble birth, wit, beauty, or so it was said, and she believed, all had been heaped upon her by the hand of chance. Such were the thoughts of the most envied heiress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, when she began to find pleasure in strolling with Julien. She was amazed at his pride; she admired the cunning of this little ple- beian. 'He will manage to get himself made a Bishop like the abbe Maury,' she said to herself. Presently the sincere and unfeigned resistance, with which our hero received a number of her ideas, began to occupy her mind; she thought about him; she reported to her cousin the pettiest details of their conver- sations, and found that she could never succeed in displaying them in every aspect. Suddenly an idea dawned upon her: 'I have the good fortune to be in love,' she told herself one day, with an indescribable transport of joy. 'I am in love, I am in love, it is quite clear! At my age, a young girl, beauti- ful, clever, where can she find sensations, if not in love? I may do what I like, I shall never feel any love for Croisenois, Caylus, e tutti quanti. They are perfect, too perfect perhaps; in short, they bore me.' She turned over in her mind all the descriptions of passion which she had read in Manon Lescaut, the Nouvelle Heloise, the Letters of a Portuguese Nun, and so forth. There was no question, of course, of anything but a grand passion; mere fleeting affection was unworthy of a girl of her age and birth. She bestowed the name of love only upon that heroic senti- ment which was to be found in France in the days of Henri IV and Bas- sompierre. That love never basely succumbed to obstacles; far from it, it caused great deeds to be done. 'What a misfortune for me that there is not a real Court like that of Catherine de' Medici or Louis XIII! I feel that I am equal to everything that is most daring and great. What should I not do with a King who was a man of feeling, like Louis XII, sighing at my feet! I should lead him to the Vendee, as Baron de Tolly is always saying, and from there he would reconquer his Kingdom; then no more talk of a Charter ... and Julien would aid me. What is it that he lacks? A name and a fortune. He would make a name for himself, he would acquire a fortune. 'The Marquis de Croisenois lacks nothing, and all his life long he will be merely a Duke, half Ultra, half Liberal, an undecided creature always

holding back from extremes, and consequently finding himself every- where in the second rank. 'Where is the great action which is not an extreme at the moment in which one undertakes it? It is when it is accomplished that it seems pos- sible to creatures of common clay. Yes, it is love with all its miracles that is going to reign in my heart; I feel it by the fire that is animating me. Heaven owed me this favour. Not in vain will it have heaped every ad- vantage upon a single head. My happiness will be worthy of myself. Each of my days will not coldly resemble the day before. There is already something grand and audacious in daring to love a man placed so far be- neath me in social position. Let me see: will he continue to deserve me? At the first sign of weakness that I observe in him, I abandon him. A girl of my birth, and with the chivalrous character which they are so kind as to attribute to me' (this was one of her father's sayings) 'ought not to be- have like a fool. 'Is not that the part that I should be playing if I loved the Marquis de Croisenois? It would be simply a repetition of the happiness of my cous- ins, whom I despise so utterly. I know beforehand everything that the poor Marquis would say to me, all that I should have to say to him in reply. What is the use of a love that makes one yawn? One might as well take to religion. I should have a scene at the signing of my marriage con- tract like my youngest cousin, with the noble relatives shedding tears, provided they were not made angry by a final condition inserted in the contract the day before by the solicitor to the other party.'

Chapter Another Danton The need for anxiety explains the character of the beautiful Mar- guerite de Valois, my aunt, who soon afterwards married the King of Navarre, whom we now see on the throne of France un- der the name of Henri IV. The need to gamble was the key to the character of this delightful princess; hence the quarrels and the reconciliations with her brothers from the age of sixteen onwards. And what does a young girl gamble with? The most precious thing she has: her reputation, the possibility of esteem for her en- tire life. Memoirs of the Due d'Angouleme, natural son of Charles IX 'With Julien and me there is no contract to be signed, no lawyer; everything is heroic, everything will be left to chance. But for nobility, which he lacks, it is the love of Marguerite de Valois for young La Mole, the most distinguished man of his time. Is it my fault if the young men at Court are such ardent devotees of the Conventions, and turn pale at the mere thought of any adventure that is slightly out of the common? A little expedition to Greece or Africa is to them the height of audacity, and even then they can only go in a troop. As soon as they find themselves alone, they become afraid, not of Bedouin spears, but of ridicule, and that drives them mad. 'My little Julien, on the contrary, will only act alone. Never, in that privileged being, is there the slightest thought of seeking the approval and support of others! He despises other people, that is why I do not despise him. 'If, with his poverty, Julien had been noble, my love would be nothing more than a piece of vulgar folly, an unfortunate marriage; I should not object to that; it would lack that element which characterises great pas- sion: the immensity of the difficulty to be overcome and the black uncer- tainty of events.'

Mademoiselle de La Mole was so absorbed in these fine speculations that next day, quite unintentionally, she sang Julien's praises to the Mar- quis de Croisenois and her brother. Her eloquence went so far that they became annoyed. 'Beware of that young man, who has so much energy,' her brother cried; 'if the Revolution begins again, he will have us all guillotined.' She made no answer, and hastened to tease her brother and the Mar- quis de Croisenois over the fear that energy inspired in them. It was nothing more, really, than the fear of meeting something unexpected, the fear of being brought up short in the presence of the unexpected ... 'Still, gentlemen, still the fear of ridicule, a monster which, unfortu- nately, died in 1816.' 'There can be no more ridicule,' M. de La Mole used to say, 'in a coun- try where there are two Parties.' His daughter had assimilated this idea. 'And so, gentlemen,' she told Julien's enemies, 'you will be haunted by fear all your lives, and afterwards people will say of you: '"It was not a wolf, it was only a shadow."' Mathilde soon left them. Her brother's remark filled her with horror; it greatly disturbed her; but after sleeping on it, she interpreted it as the highest possible praise. 'In this age, when all energy is dead, his energy makes them afraid. I shall tell him what my brother said. I wish to see what answer he will make. But I shall choose a moment when his eyes are glowing. Then he cannot lie to me. 'Another Danton?' she went on after a long, vague spell of musing. 'Very well! Let us suppose that the Revolution has begun. What parts would Croisenois and my brother play? It is all prescribed for them: sub- lime resignation. They would be heroic sheep, allowing their throats to be cut without a word. Their sole fear when dying would still be of com- mitting a breach of taste. My little Julien would blow out the brains of the Jacobin who came to arrest him, if he had the slightest hope of escap- ing. He, at least, has no fear of bad taste.' These last words made her pensive again; they revived painful memories, and destroyed all her courage. They reminded her of the wit- ticisms of MM. de Caylus, de Croisenois, de Luz, and her brother. These gentlemen were unanimous in accusing Julien of a priestly air, humble and hypocritical. 'But,' she went on, suddenly, her eye sparkling with joy, 'by the bitter- ness and the frequency of their sarcasms, they prove, in spite of

themselves, that he is the most distinguished man that we have seen this winter. What do his faults, his absurdities matter? He has greatness, and they are shocked by it, they who in other respects are so kind and indul- gent. He knows well that he is poor, and that he has studied to become a priest; they are squadron commanders, and have no need of study; it is a more comfortable life. 'In spite of all the drawbacks of his eternal black coat, and of that priestly face, which he is obliged to assume, poor boy, if he is not to die of hunger, his merit alarms them, nothing could be clearer. And that priestly expression, he no longer wears it when we have been for a few moments by ourselves. Besides, when these gentlemen say anything which they consider clever and startling, is not their first glance always at Julien? I have noticed that distinctly. And yet they know quite well that he never speaks to them, unless he is asked a question. It is only my- self that he addresses. He thinks that I have a lofty nature. He replies to their objections only so far as politeness requires. He becomes respectful at once. With me, he will discuss things for hours on end, he is not sure of his own ideas if I offer the slightest objection. After all, all this winter we have not heard a shot fired; the only possible way to attract attention has been by one's talk. Well, my father, a superior man, and one who will greatly advance the fortunes of our family, respects Julien. All the rest hate him, no one despises him, except my mother's religious friends.' The Comte de Caylus had or pretended to have a great passion for horses; he spent all his time in his stables, and often took his luncheon there. This great passion, combined with his habit of never laughing, had won him a great esteem among his friends: he was the 'strong man' of their little circle. As soon as it had assembled next day behind Madame de La Mole's armchair, Julien not being present, M. de Caylus, supported by Crois- enois and Norbert, launched a violent attack upon the good opinion Mathilde had of Julien, without any reason and almost as soon as he saw Mademoiselle de La Mole. She detected this stratagem a mile off, and was charmed by it. 'There they are all in league,' she said to herself, 'against a man who has not ten louis to his name, and can answer them only when he is questioned. They are afraid of him in his black coat. What would he be with epaulettes?' Never had she been so brilliant. At the first onslaught, she covered Caylus and his allies with witty sarcasm. When the fire of these brilliant officers' pleasantries was extinguished:

'Tomorrow some country squire from the mountains of the Franche- Comte,' she said to M. de Caylus, 'has only to discover that Julien is his natural son, and give him a name and a few thousand francs, and in six weeks he will have grown moustaches like yourselves, gentlemen; in six months he will be an officer of hussars like yourselves, gentlemen. And then the greatness of his character will no longer be a joke. I can see you reduced, My Lord Duke-to-be, to that old and worthless plea: the superi- ority of the nobility of the Court to the provincial nobility. But what de- fence have you left if I choose to take an extreme case, if I am so unkind as to make Julien's father a Spanish Duke, a prisoner of war at Besancon in Napoleon's time, who, from a scruple of conscience, acknowledges him on his deathbed?' All these assumptions of a birth out of wedlock were regarded by MM. de Caylus and de Croisenois as in distinctly bad taste. This was all that they saw in Mathilde's argument. Obedient as Norbert was, his sister's meaning was so unmistakable that he assumed an air of gravity, little in keeping, it must be confessed, with his genial, smiling features. He ventured to say a few words: 'Are you unwell, dear?' Mathilde answered him with a mock-serious expression. 'You must be feeling very ill to reply to a joke with a sermon. 'A sermon, from you! Are you thinking of asking to be made a Prefect?' Mathilde very soon forgot the annoyance of the Comte de Caylus, Norbert's ill humour and the silent despair of M. de Croisenois. She had to make up her mind over a desperate idea which had taken possession of her. 'Julien is quite sincere with me,' she told herself; 'at his age, in an in- ferior state of fortune, wretched as an astounding ambition makes him, he needs a woman friend. I can be that friend; but I see no sign in him of love. With the audacity of his nature, he would have spoken to me of his love.' This uncertainty, this inward discussion, which, from now onwards, occupied every moment of Mathilde's life, and in support of which, whenever Julien addressed her, she found fresh arguments, completely banished those periods of depression to which she was so liable. The daughter of a man of intelligence who might become a Minister, and restore their forests to the Clergy, Mademoiselle de La Mole had been, in the Convent of the Sacre-Coeur, the object of the most extravag- ant flatteries. The harm done in this way can never be effaced. They had persuaded her that, in view of all her advantages of birth, fortune, etc.,

she ought to be happier than other girls. This is the source of the bore- dom from which princes suffer, and of all their follies. Mathilde had not been immune to the fatal influence of this idea. However intelligent a girl may be, she cannot be on her guard for ten years against the flattery of an entire convent, especially when it appears to be so well founded. > From the moment in which she decided that she was in love with Juli- en, she was no longer bored. Every day she congratulated herself on the decision she had made to indulge in a grand passion. 'This amusement has its dangers,' she thought. 'All the better! A thousand times better! 'Without a grand passion, I was languishing with boredom at the best moment in a girl's life, between sixteen and twenty. I have already wasted my best years; with no pleasure but to listen to the nonsense talked by my mother's friends, who at Coblenz, in 1792, were not quite, one gathers, so strict in their conduct, as they are today in speech.' It was while Mathilde was still devoured by this great uncertainty that Julien was unable to understand the gaze which she kept fastened upon him. He did indeed find an increased coldness in Comte Herbert's man- ner, and a stiffening of pride in that of MM. de Caylus, de Luz and de Croisenois. He was used to it. This discomfiture befell him at times after an evening in which he had shone more brightly than befitted his posi- tion. But for the special welcome which Mathilde extended to him, and the curiosity which the whole scene inspired in him, he would have re- frained from following into the garden these brilliant young men with the moustaches, when after dinner they escorted Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'Yes, I cannot possibly blind myself to the fact,' thought Julien, 'Mademoiselle de La Mole keeps looking at me in a strange fashion. But, even when her beautiful blue eyes seem to gaze at me with least re- straint, I can always read in them a cold, malevolent scrutiny. Is it pos- sible that this is love? How different from the look in Madame de Renal's eyes.' One evening after dinner, Julien, who had gone with M. de La Mole to his study, came rapidly out to the garden. As he walked boldly up to the group round Mathilde, he overheard a few words uttered in a loud voice. She was teasing her brother. Julien heard his own name uttered distinctly twice. He appeared; a profound silence at once fell, and vain efforts were made to break it. Mademoiselle de La Mole and her brother were too much excited to think of another topic of conversation. MM. de

Caylus, de Croisenois, de Luz and another of their friends met Julien with an icy coldness. He withdrew.

Chapter A Plot Disconnected remarks, chance meetings turn into proofs of the utmost clarity in the eyes of the imaginative man, if he has any fire in his heart. SCHILLER On the following day he again surprised Norbert and his sister, who were talking about him. On his arrival, a deathly silence fell, as on the day before. His suspicions knew no bounds. 'Can these charming young people be planning to make a fool of me? I must own, that is far more probable, far more natural than a pretended passion on the part of Ma- demoiselle de La Mole, for a poor devil of a secretary. For one thing, do these people have passions? Mystification is their specialty. They are jealous of my wretched little superiority in language. Being jealous, that is another of their weaknesses. That explains everything. Mademoiselle de La Mole hopes to persuade me that she is singling me out, simply to offer me as a spectacle to her intended.' This cruel suspicion completely changed Julien's moral attitude. The idea encountered in his heart a germ of love which it had no difficulty in destroying. This love was founded only upon Mathilde's rare beauty, or rather upon her regal manner and her admirable style in dress. In this re- spect Julien was still an upstart. A beautiful woman of fashion is, we are assured, the sight that most astonishes a clever man of peasant origin when he arrives amid the higher ranks of society. It was certainly not Mathilde's character that had set Julien dreaming for days past. He had enough sense to grasp that he knew nothing about her character. Everything that he saw of it might be only a pretence. For instance, Mathilde would not for anything in the world have failed to hear mass on a Sunday; almost every day she went to church with her mother. If, in the drawing-room of the Hotel de La Mole, some impudent fellow forgot where he was and allowed himself to make the remotest al- lusion to some jest aimed at the real or supposed interests of Throne or

Altar, Mathilde would at once assume an icy severity. Her glance, which was so sparkling, took on all the expressionless pride of an old family portrait. But Julien knew for certain that she always had in her room one or two of the most philosophical works of Voltaire. He himself frequently ab- stracted a volume or two of the handsome edition so magnificently bound. By slightly separating the other volumes on the shelf, he con- cealed the absence of the volume he was taking away; but soon he dis- covered that someone else was reading Voltaire. He had recourse to a trick of the Seminary, he placed some little pieces of horsehair across the volumes which he supposed might interest Mademoiselle de La Mole. They vanished for weeks at a time. M. de La Mole, losing patience with his bookseller, who kept sending him all the sham Memoirs, gave Julien orders to buy every new book that was at all sensational. But, so that the poison might not spread through the household, the secretary was instructed to place these books in a little bookcase that stood in the Marquis's own room. He soon acquired the certainty that if any of these books were hostile to the interests of Throne and Altar, they were not long in vanishing. It was certainly not Norbert that was reading them. Julien, exaggerating the importance of this discovery, credited Ma- demoiselle de La Mole with a Machiavellian duplicity. This feigned criminality wa a charm in his eyes, almost the only moral charm that she possessed. The tediousness of hypocrisy and virtuous conversation drove him to this excess. He excited his imagination rather than let himself be carried away by love. It was after he had lost himself in dreams of the elegance of Ma- demoiselle de La Mole's figure, the excellent taste of her toilet, the white- ness of her hand, the beauty of her arm, the disinvoltura of all her move- ments, that he found himself in love. Then, to complete her charm, he imagined her to be a Catherine de' Medici. Nothing was too profound or too criminal for the character that he assigned to her. It was the ideal of the Maslons, the Frilairs and Castanedes whom he had admired in his younger days. It was, in short, the ideal, to him, of Paris. Was ever anything so absurd as to imagine profundity or criminality in the Parisian character? 'It is possible that this trio may be making a fool of me,' he thought. The reader has learned very little of Julien's nature if he has not already seen the sombre, frigid expression that he assumed when his eyes met

those of Mathilde. A bitter irony repulsed the assurances of friendship with which Mademoiselle de La Mole in astonishment ventured on two or three occasions, to try him. Piqued by his sudden eccentricity, the heart of this girl, naturally cold, bored, responsive to intelligence, became as passionate as it was in her nature to be. But there was also a great deal of pride in Mathilde's nature, and the birth of a sentiment which made all her happiness de- pendent upon another was attended by a sombre melancholy. Julien had made sufficient progress since his arrival in Paris to discern that this was not the barren melancholy of boredom. Instead of being eager, as in the past, for parties, shows and distractions of every kind, she avoided them. Music performed by French singers bored Mathilde to death, and yet Julien, who made it his duty to be present at the close of the Opera, ob- served that she made her friends take her there as often as possible. He thought he could detect that she had lost a little of the perfect balance which shone in all her actions. She would sometimes reply to her friends with witticisms that were offensive in their pointed emphasis. It seemed to him that she had taken a dislike to the Marquis de Croisenois. 'That young man must have a furious passion for money, not to go off and leave a girl like that, however rich she may be!' thought Julien. As for himself, indignant at the insults offered to masculine dignity, his cold- ness towards her increased. Often he went the length of replying with positive discourtesy. However determined he might be not to be taken in by the signs of in- terest shown by Mathilde, they were so evident on certain days, and Juli- en, from whose eyes the scales were beginning to fall, found her so at- tractive, that he was at times embarrassed by them. 'The skill and forbearance of these young men of fashion will end by triumphing over my want of experience,' he told himself; 'I must go away, and put an end to all this.' The Marquis had recently entrusted to him the management of a number of small properties and houses which he owned in lower Languedoc. A visit to the place became necessary: M. de La Mole gave a reluctant consent. Except in matters of high ambition, Julien had become his second self. 'When all is said and done, they have not managed to catch me,' Julien told himself as he prepared for his departure. 'Whether the jokes which Mademoiselle de La Mole makes at the expense of these gentlemen be real, or only intended to inspire me with confidence, I have been amused by them.

'If there is no conspiracy against the carpenter's son, Mademoiselle de La Mole is inexplicable, but she is just as much so to the Marquis de Croisenois as to me. Yesterday, for instance, her ill humour was quite genuine, and I had the pleasure of seeing discomfited in my favour a young man as noble and rich as I am penniless and plebeian. That is my finest triumph. It will keep me in good spirits in my post-chaise, as I scour the plains of Languedoc.' He had kept his departure secret, but Mathilde knew better than he that he was leaving Paris next day, and for a long time. She pleaded a splitting headache, which was made worse by the close atmosphere of the drawing-room. She walked for hours in the garden, and so pursued with her mordant pleasantries Norbert, the Marquis de Croisenois, Caylus, de Luz and various other young men who had dined at the Hotel de La Mole, that she forced them to take their leave. She looked at Julien in a strange fashion. 'This look is perhaps a piece of play-acting,' thought he; 'but her quick breathing, all that emotion! Bah!' he said to himself, 'who am I to judge of these matters? This is an example of the most consummate, the most arti- ficial behaviour to be found among the women of Paris. That quick breathing, which so nearly proved too much for me, she will have learned from Leontine Fay, whom she admires so.' They were now left alone; the conversation was plainly languishing. 'No! Julien has no feeling for me,' Mathilde told herself with genuine distress. As he took leave of her, she clutched his arm violently: 'You will receive a letter from me this evening,' she told him in a voice so strained as to be barely audible. This had an immediate effect on Julien. 'My father,' she went on, 'has a most natural regard for the services that you render him. You must not go tomorrow; find some excuse.' And she ran from the garden. Her figure was charming. It would have been impossible to have a prettier foot, she ran with a grace that enchanted Julien; but guess what was his second thought when she had quite vanished. He was offended by the tone of command in which she had uttered the words, you must. Similarly Louis XV, as he breathed his last, was keenly annoyed by the words you must awkwardly employed by his Chief Physician, and yet Louis XV was no upstart. An hour later, a footman handed Julien a letter; it was nothing less than a declaration of love.

'The style is not unduly affected,' he said to himself, seeking by literary observations to contain the joy that was contorting his features and for- cing him to laugh in spite of himself. 'And so I,' he suddenly exclaimed, his excitement being too strong to be held in check, 'I, a poor peasant, have received a declaration of love from a great lady! 'As for myself, I have not done badly,' he went on, controlling his joy as far as was possible. 'I have succeeded in preserving the dignity of my character. I have never said that I was in love.' He began to study the shapes of her letters; Mademoiselle de La Mole wrote in a charming little English hand. He required some physical occupation to take his mind from a joy which was bordering on delirium. 'Your departure obliges me to speak ... It would be beyond my endur- ance not to see you any more.' A sudden thought occurred to strike Julien as a discovery, interrupt the examination that he was making of Mathilde's letter, and intensify his joy. 'I am preferred to the Marquis de Croisenois,' he cried, 'I, who never say anything that is not serious! And he is so handsome! He wears moustaches, a charming uniform; he always manages to say, just at the right moment, something witty and clever.' It was an exquisite moment for Julien; he roamed about the garden, mad with happiness. Later, he went upstairs to his office, and sent in his name to the Mar- quis de La Mole, who fortunately had not gone out. He had no difficulty in proving to him, by showing him various marked papers that had ar- rived from Normandy, that the requirements of his employer's lawsuits there obliged him to postpone his departure for Languedoc. 'I am very glad you are not going,' the Marquis said to him, when they had finished their business, 'I like to see you.' Julien left the room; this speech disturbed him. 'And I am going to seduce his daughter! To render impossible, per- haps, that marriage with the Marquis de Croisenois, which is the bright spot in his future: if he is not made Duke, at least his daughter will be en- titled to a tabouret.' Julien thought of starting for Languedoc in spite of Mathilde's letter, in spite of the explanation he had given the Marquis. This virtuous impulse soon faded. 'How generous I am,' he said to himself; 'I, a plebeian, to feel pity for a family of such high rank! I, whom the Duc de Chaulnes calls a domestic! How does the Marquis increase his vast fortune? By selling national se- curities, when he hears at the Chateau that there is to be the threat of a

Coup d' Etat next day. And I, cast down to the humblest rank by a step- motherly Providence, I, whom Providence has endowed with a noble heart and not a thousand francs of income, that is to say not enough for my daily bread, literally speaking, not enough for my daily bread; am I to re- fuse a pleasure that is offered me? A limpid spring which wells up to quench my thirst in the burning desert of mediocrity over which I trace my painful course! Faith, I am no such fool; everyone for himself in this desert of selfishness which is called life.' And he reminded himself of several disdainful glances aimed at him by Madame de La Mole, and especially by the ladies, her friends. The pleasure of triumphing over the Marquis de Croisenois completed the rout of this lingering trace of virtue. 'How I should love to make him angry!' said Julien; 'with what assur- ance would I now thrust at him with my sword.' And he struck a sweep- ing blow at the air. 'Until now, I was a smug, basely profiting by a trace of courage. After this letter, I am his equal. 'Yes,' he said to himself with an infinite delight, dwelling on the words, 'our merits, the Marquis's and mine, have been weighed, and the poor carpenter from the Jura wins the day. 'Good!' he cried, 'here is the signature to my reply ready found. Do not go and imagine, Mademoiselle de La Mole, that I am forgetting my sta- tion. I shall make you realise and feel that it is for the son of a carpenter that you are betraying a descendant of the famous Guy de Croisenois, who followed Saint Louis on his Crusade.' Julien was unable to contain his joy. He was obliged to go down to the garden. His room, in which he had locked himself up, seemed too con- fined a space for him to breathe in. 'I, a poor peasant from the Jura,' he kept on repeating, 'I, I condemned always to wear this dismal black coat! Alas, twenty years ago, I should have worn uniform like them! In those days a man of my sort was either killed, or a General at six and thirty.' The letter, which he kept tightly clasped in his hand, gave him the bearing and pose of a hero. 'Nowadays, it is true, with the said black coat, at the age of forty, a man has emoluments of one hundred thousand francs and the Blue Riband, like the Bishop of Beauvais. 'Oh, well!' he said to himself, laughing like Mephistopheles, 'I have more sense than they; I know how to choose the uniform of my genera- tion.' And he felt an intensification of his ambition and of his attachment to the clerical habit. 'How many Cardinals have there been of humbler

birth than mine, who have risen to positions of government! My fellow- countryman Granvelle, for instance.' 12 Gradually Julien's agitation subsided; prudence rose to the surface. He said to himself, like his master Tartuffe, whose part he knew by heart: 'I might suppose these words an honest artifice ... Nay, I shall not be- lieve so flattering a speech Unless some favour shown by her for whom I sigh Assure me that they mean all that they might imply.' (Tartuffe, Act IV, Scene V) 'Tartuffe also was ruined by a woman, and he was as good a man as most ... My answer may be shewn ... a mishap for which we find this remedy,' he went on, pronouncing each word slowly, and in accents of restrained ferocity, 'we begin it by quoting the strongest expressions from the letter of the sublime Mathilde. 'Yes, but then four of M. de Croisenois's flunkeys will spring upon me, and tear the original from me. 'No, for I am well armed, and am accustomed, as they know, to firing on flunkeys. 'Very well! Say, one of them has some courage; he springs upon me. He has been promised a hundred napoleons. I kill or injure him, all the better, that is what they want. I am flung into prison with all the forms of law; I appear in the police court, and they send me, with all justice and equity on the judges' part, to keep MM. Fontan and Magalon company at Poissy. There, I lie upon straw with four hundred poor wretches, pell- mell ... And I am to feel some pity for these people,' he cried, springing impetuously to his feet. 'What pity do they show for the Third Estate when they have us in their power?' These words were the dying breath of his gratitude to M. de La Mole which, in spite of himself, had tormen- ted him until then. 'Not so fast, my fine gentlemen, I understand this little stroke of Ma- chiavellianism; the abbe Maslon or M. Castanede of the Seminary could not have been more clever. You rob me of my incitement, the letter, and I become the second volume of Colonel Caron at Colmar. 'One moment, gentlemen, I am going to send the fatal letter in a care- fully sealed packet to the custody of M. l'abbe Pirard. He is an honest man, a Jansenist, and as such out of reach of the temptations of the Budget. Yes, but he opens letters ... it is to Fouque that I must send this one.' 12.Antoine de Granvelle, born at Besancon in 1517, was Minister to Charles V and Philip II and Governor of the Netherlands.

It must be admitted the glare in Julien's eyes was ghastly, his expres- sion hideous; it was eloquent of unmitigated crime. He was an unhappy man at war with the whole of society. 'To arms!' cried Julien. And he sprang with one bound down the steps that led from the house. He entered the letter-writer's booth at the street corner; the man was alarmed. 'Copy this,' said Julien, giving him Ma- demoiselle de La Mole's letter. While the writer was thus engaged, he himself wrote to Fouque; he begged him to keep for him a precious article. 'But,' he said to himself, laying down his pen, 'the secret room in the post office will open my let- ter, and give you back the one you seek; no, gentlemen.' He went and bought an enormous Bible from a Protestant bookseller, skilfully con- cealed Mathilde's letter in the boards, had it packed up with his own let- ter, and his parcel went off by the mail, addressed to one of Fouque's workmen, whose name was unknown to anybody in Paris. This done, he returned joyful and brisk to the Hotel de La Mole. 'It is our turn, now,' he exclaimed, as he locked himself into his room, and flung off his coat: 'What, Mademoiselle,' he wrote to Mathilde, 'it is Mademoiselle de La Mole who, by the hand of Arsene, her father's servant, transmits a letter couched in too seductive terms to a poor carpenter from the Jura, doubt- less to play a trick upon his simplicity ... ' And he transcribed the most unequivocal sentences from the letter he had received. His own would have done credit to the diplomatic prudence of M. le Chevalier de Beauvoisis. It was still only ten o'clock; Julien, intoxicated with happiness and with the sense of his own power, so novel to a poor devil like himself, went off to the Italian opera. He heard his friend Ger- onimo sing. Never had music raised him to so high a pitch. He was a god. 13 13.Esprit per, pre. gui II. A. 30. (Note by Stendhal.)

Chapter A Girl's Thoughts So much perplexity? So many sleepless nights! Good God! Am I making myself despicable? He will despise me himself. But he's leaving, he's going. ALFRED DE MUSSET It was not without an inward struggle that Mathilde had brought her- self to write. Whatever might have been the beginning of her interest in Julien, it soon overcame the pride which, ever since she had been aware of herself, had reigned alone in her heart. That cold and haughty spirit was carried away for the first time by a passionate sentiment. But if this overcame her pride, it was still faithful to the habits bred of pride. Two months of struggle and of novel sensations had so to speak altered her whole moral nature. Mathilde thought she had happiness in sight. This prospect, irresistible to a courageous spirit combined with a superior intellect, had to make a long fight against dignity and every sentiment of common duty. One day she entered her mother's room, at seven o'clock in the morning, begging her for leave to retire to Villequier. The Marquise did not even deign to answer her, and recommended her to go back to her bed. This was the last effort made by plain sense and the deference paid to accepted ideas. The fear of wrongdoing and of shocking the ideas held as sacred by the Caylus, the de Luz, the Croisenois, had little or no hold over her; such creatures as they did not seem to her to be made to understand her; she would have consulted them had it been a question of buying a car- riage or an estate. Her real terror was that Julien might be displeased with her. 'Perhaps, too, he has only the outward appearance of a superior person.' She abhorred want of character, it was her sole objection to the hand- some young men among whom she lived. The more gracefully they mocked at everything which departed from the fashion, or which

followed it wrongly when intending to follow it, the more they con- demned themselves in her eyes. They were brave, and that was all. 'And besides, how are they brave?' she asked herself: 'in a duel. But the duel is nothing more now than a formality. Everything is known beforehand, even what a man is to say when he falls. Lying on the grass, his hand on his heart, he must extend a handsome pardon to his adversary and leave a message for a fair one who is often imaginary, or who goes to a ball on the day of his death, for fear of arousing suspicion. 'A man will face danger at the head of a squadron all glittering with steel, but a danger that is solitary, strange, sudden, truly ugly? 'Alas!' said Mathilde, 'it was at the Court of Henri in that one found men great by character as well as by birth! Ah, if Julien had served at Jar- nac or at Moncontour, I should no longer be in doubt. In those days of strength and prowess, Frenchmen were not mere dolls. The day of battle was almost the day of least perplexity. 'Their life was not imprisoned like an Egyptian mummy, within an en- velope always common to them all, always the same. Yes,' she went on, 'there was more true courage in crossing the town alone at eleven o'clock at night, after leaving the Hotel de Soissons, occupied by Catherine de' Medici, than there is today in dashing to Algiers. A man's life was a suc- cession of hazards. Nowadays civilisation has banished hazard, there is no room for the unexpected. If it appears in our ideas, there are not epi- grams enough to cope with it; if it appears in events, no act of cowardice is too great for our fear. Whatever folly our fear makes us commit is ex- cused us. Degenerate and boring age! What would Boniface de La Mole have said if, raising his severed head from the tomb, he had seen, in 1793, seventeen of his descendants allow themselves to be penned like sheep, to be guillotined a day or two later? Their death was certain, but it would have been in bad form to defend themselves and at least kill a Ja- cobin or two. Ah! In the heroic age of France, in the days of Boniface de La Mole, Julien would have been the squadron commander, and my brother the young priest, properly behaved, with wisdom in his eyes and reason on his lips.' A few months since, Mathilde had despaired of meeting anyone a little different from the common pattern. She had found a certain happiness in allowing herself to write to various young men of fashion. This act of boldness, so unconventional, so imprudent in a young girl, might dis- honour her in the eyes of M. de Croisenois, of his father, the Duc de Chaulnes, and of the whole house of Chaulnes, who, seeing the projected

marriage broken off, would wish to know the reason. At that time, on the night after she had written one of these letters, Mathilde was unable to sleep. But these letters were mere replies. Now she had ventured to say that she was in love. She had written first (what a terrible word!) to a man in the lowest rank of society. This circumstance assured her, in the event of discovery, eternal dis- grace. Which of the women who came to see her mother would dare to take her part? What polite expression could be put into their mouths to lessen the shock of the fearful contempt of the drawing-rooms? And even to speak to a man was fearful, but to write! 'There are things which one does not write,' Napoleon exclaimed when he heard of the surrender of Baylen. And it was Julien who had told her of this saying! As though teaching her a lesson in advance. But all this was still nothing, Mathilde's anguish had other causes. Oblivious of the horrible effect upon society, of the ineradicable blot, the universal contempt, for she was outraging her caste, Mathilde was writ- ing to a person of a very different nature from the Croisenois, the de Luz, the Caylus. The depth, the strangeness of Julien's character had alarmed her, even when she was forming an ordinary relation with him. And she was go- ing to make him her lover, possibly her master! 'What claims will he not assert, if ever he is in a position to do as he likes with me? Very well! I shall say to myself like Medea: "Midst all these perils, I have still MYSELF."' Julien had no reverence for nobility of blood, she understood. Worse, still, perhaps, he felt no love for her! In these final moments of tormenting doubts, she was visited by ideas of feminine pride. 'Everything ought to be strange in the lot of a girl like myself,' cried Mathilde, with impatience. And so the pride that had been inculcated in her from her cradle began to fight against her virtue. It was at this point that Julien's threatened departure came to precipitate events. (Such characters are fortunately quite rare.) Late that night, Julien was malicious enough to have an extremely heavy trunk carried down to the porter's lodge; to carry it, he summoned the footman who was courting Mademoiselle de La Mole's maid. 'This device may lead to no result,' he said to himself, 'but if it proves success- ful, she will think that I have gone.' He went to sleep, highly delighted with his trick. Mathilde never closed an eye.

Next morning, at a very early hour, Julien left the house unobserved, but returned before eight o'clock. No sooner was he in the library than Mademoiselle de La Mole ap- peared on the threshold. He handed her his answer. He thought that it was incumbent upon him to speak to her; this, at least, was the most po- lite course, but Mademoiselle de La Mole would not listen to him and vanished. Julien was overjoyed, he had not known what to say to her. 'If all this is not a trick arranged with Comte Norbert, plainly it must have been my frigid glance that has kindled the freakish love which this girl of noble birth has taken it into her head to feel for me. I should be a little too much of a fool if I ever allowed myself to be drawn into feeling any attraction towards the great flaxen doll.' This piece of reasoning left him more cold and calculating than he had ever been. 'In the battle that is preparing,' he went on, 'pride of birth will be like a high hill, forming a military position between her and myself. It is there that we must manoeuvre. I have done wrong to remain in Paris; this postponement of my departure cheapens me, and exposes my flank if all this is only a game. What danger was there in my going? I was fooling them, if they are fooling me. If her interest in me has any reality, I was increasing that interest an hundredfold.' Mademoiselle de La Mole's letter had so flattered Julien's vanity that, while he laughed at what was happening to him, he had forgotten to think seriously of the advantages of departure. It was a weakness of his character to be extremely sensitive to his own faults. He was extremely annoyed at this instance of his weakness, and had almost ceased to think of the incredible victory which had preceded this slight check when, about nine o'clock, Mademoiselle de La Mole ap- peared on the threshold of the library, flung him a letter, and fled. 'It appears that this is to be a romance told in letters,' he said, as he picked this one up. 'The enemy makes a false move, now I am going to bring coldness and virtue into play.' The letter called for a definite answer with an arrogance which in- creased his inward gaiety. He gave himself the pleasure of mystifying, for the space of two pages, the people who might wish to make a fool of him, and it was with a fresh pleasantry that he announced, towards the end of his reply, his decision to depart on the following morning. This letter finished: 'The garden can serve me as a post office,' he thought, and made his way there. He looked up at the window of Ma- demoiselle de La Mole's room.

It was on the first floor, next to her mother's apartment, but there was a spacious mezzanine beneath. This first floor stood so high, that, as he advanced beneath the lime-al- ley, letter in hand, Julien could not be seen from Mademoiselle de La Mole's window. The vault formed by the limes, which were admirably pleached, intercepted the view. 'But what is this!' Julien said to himself, angrily, 'another imprudence! If they have decided to make a fool of me, to let myself be seen with a letter in my hand, is to play the enemy's game.' Norbert's room was immediately above his sister's, and if Julien emerged from the alley formed by the pleached branches of the limes, the Count and his friends would be able to follow his every movement. Mademoiselle de La Mole appeared behind her closed window; he half showed her his letter; she bowed her head. At once Julien ran up to his own room, and happened to meet, on the main staircase, the fair Mathilde, who snatched the letter with perfect composure and laughing eyes. 'What passion there was in the eyes of that poor Madame de Renal,' Julien said to himself, 'when, even after six months of intimate relations, she ventured to receive a letter from me! Never once, I am sure, did she look at me with a laugh in her eyes.' He did not express to himself so clearly the rest of his comment; was he ashamed of the futility of his motives? 'But also what a difference,' his thoughts added, 'in the elegance of her morning gown, in the elegance of her whole appearance! On catching sight of Mademoiselle de La Mole thirty yards off, a man of taste could tell the rank that she occupies in so- ciety. That is what one may call an explicit merit.' Still playing with his theme, Julien did not yet confess to himself the whole of his thoughts; Madame de Renal had had no Marquis de Crois- enois to sacrifice to him. He had had as a rival only that ignoble Sub-Pre- fect M. Charcot, who had assumed the name of Maugiron, because the Maugirons were extinct. At five o'clock, Julien received a third letter; it was flung at him from the library door. Mademoiselle de La Mole again fled. 'What a mania for writing,' he said to himself with a laugh, 'when it is so easy for us to talk! The enemy wishes to have my letters, that is clear, and plenty of them!' He was in no haste to open this last. 'More elegant phrases,' he thought; but he turned pale as he read it. It consisted of eight lines only. 'I have to speak to you: I must speak to you, tonight; when one o'clock strikes, be in the garden. Take the gardener's long ladder from beside the

well; place it against my window and come up to my room. There is a moon: no matter.'

Chapter Is it a Plot? Ah! How cruel is the interval between the conception of a great project and its execution! What vain terrors! What irresolutions! Life is at stake. Far more than life—honour! SCHILLER 'This is becoming serious,' thought Julien ... 'and a little too obvious,' he added, after a moment's reflection. 'Why! This pretty young beauty can speak to me in the library with a freedom which, thank heaven, is unrestricted; the Marquis, for fear of my bothering him with accounts, never comes there. Why! M. de La Mole and Comte Norbert, the only people who ever show their faces here, are absent almost all day; it is easy to watch for the moment of their return to the house, and the sub- lime Mathilde, for whose hand a Sovereign Prince would not be too noble, wishes me to commit an act of abominable imprudence! 'It is clear, they wish to ruin me, or to make a fool of me, at least. First of all, they sought to ruin me by my letters; these proved cautious; very well, now they require an action that shall be as clear as daylight. These pretty little gentlemen think me too simple or too conceited. The devil! With the brightest moon you ever saw, to climb up by a ladder to a first floor, five and twenty feet from the ground! They will have plenty of time to see me, even from the neighbouring houses. I shall be a fine sight on my ladder!' Julien went up to his room and began to pack his trunk, whistling as he did so. He had made up his mind to go, and not even to answer the letter. But this sage resolution gave him no peace of heart. 'If, by any chance,' he said to himself, suddenly, his trunk packed and shut, 'Mathilde were sincere! Then I shall be cutting in her eyes the most perfect figure of a coward. I have no birth, so I require great qualities, ready on demand, with no flattering suppositions, qualities proved by eloquent deeds ... ' He spent a quarter of an hour pacing the floor of his room. 'What use in denying it?' he asked himself, at length; 'I shall be a coward in her

eyes. I lose not only the most brilliant young person in high society, as everyone was saying at M. le Duc de Retz's ball, but, furthermore, the heavenly pleasure of seeing her throw over for me the Marquis de Crois- enois, the son of a Duke, and a future Duke himself. A charming young man who has all the qualities that I lack: a ready wit, birth, fortune ... 'This remorse will pursue me all my life, not for her, there are heaps of mistresses, "but only one honour", as old Don Diego says, and here I am clearly and plainly recoiling from the first peril that comes my way; for that duel with M. de Beauvoisis was a mere joke. This is quite different. I may be shot point-blank by a servant, but that is the least danger; I may forfeit my honour. 'This is becoming serious, my boy,' he went on, with a Gascon gaiety and accent. 'Honur is at stake. A poor devil kept down by fate in my lowly station will never find such an opportunity again; I shall have ad- ventures, but tawdry ones ... ' He reflected at length, he paced the room with a hurried step, stopping short now and again. There stood in his room a magnificent bust in marble of Cardinal Richelieu, which persistently caught his eye. This bust appeared to be gazing at him sternly, as though reproaching him for the want of that audacity which ought to be so natural to the French character. 'In thy time, great man, should I have hesitated? 'At the worst,' Julien told himself finally, 'let us suppose that all this is a plot, it is a very dark one, and highly compromising for a young girl. They know that I am not the man to keep silent. They will therefore have to kill me. That was all very well in 1574, in the days of Boniface de La Mole, but the La Mole of today would never dare. These people are not the same now. Mademoiselle de La Mole is so envied! Four hundred drawing-rooms would echo with her disgrace next day, and with what rejoicing! 'The servants chatter among themselves of the marked preference that is shown me; I know it, I have heard them ... 'On the other hand, her letters! ... They may suppose that I have them on me. They surprise me in her room, and take them from me. I shall have two, three, four, any number of men to deal with. But these men, where will they collect them? Where is one to find discreet agents in Par- is? They are afraid of the law ... Gad! It will be the Caylus and Crois- enois and de Luz themselves. The thought of that moment, and the fool- ish figure I shall cut there among them will be what has tempted them. Beware the fate of Abelard, Master Secretary!

'Begad, then, gentlemen, you shall bear the mark of my fists, I shall strike at your faces, like Caesar's soldiers at Pharsalia ... As for the let- ters, I can put them in a safe place.' Julien made copies of the two last, concealed them in a volume of the fine Voltaire from the library, and went himself with the originals to the post. When he returned: 'Into what madness am I rushing!' he said to him- self with surprise and terror. He had been a quarter of an hour without considering his action of the coming night in all its aspects. 'But, if I refuse, I must despise myself ever afterwards. All my life long, that action will be a matter for doubt to me, and such a doubt is the most bitter agony. Have I not felt it over Amanda's lover? I believe that I should find it easier to forgive myself what was clearly a crime; once I had confessed it, I should cease to think about it. 'What! I shall have been the rival of a man bearing one of the best names in France, and I myself, with a light heart, am to declare myself his inferior! Indeed, there is a strain of cowardice in not going. That word settles everything,' cried Julien, springing to his feet... 'besides, she is a real beauty! 'If this is not treachery, how foolishly she is behaving for me! ... If it is a mystification, begad, gentlemen, it rests with me to turn the jest to earnest, and so I shall. 'But if they pinion my arms, the moment I enter the room; they may have set some diabolical machine there ready for me! 'It is like a duel,' he told himself with a laugh, 'there is a parry for every thrust, my fencing master says, but the Almighty, who likes things to end, makes one of the fighters forget to parry. Anyhow, here is what will answer them'; he drew his pocket pistols; and, albeit they were fully charged, renewed the primings. There were still many hours to wait; in order to have something to do, Julien wrote to Fouque: 'My friend, open the enclosed letter only in case of accident, if you hear it said that something strange has befallen me. Then, erase the proper names from the manuscript that I am sending you, and make eight copies of it which you will send to the newspapers of Marseilles, Bordeaux, Lyons, Brussels, etc.; ten days later, have the manuscript printed, send the first copy to M. le Marquis de La Mole, and a fortnight after that, scatter the other copies by night about the streets of Verrieres.' This brief exonerating memoir, arranged in the form of a tale, which Fouque was to open only in case of accident, Julien made as little

compromising as possible to Mademoiselle de La Mole, but, neverthe- less, it described his position very accurately. He had just sealed his packet when the dinner-bell rang; it made his heart beat violently. His imagination, preoccupied with the narrative which he had just composed, was a prey to all sorts of tragic presenti- ment. He had seen himself seized by servants, garrotted, carried down to a cellar with a gag in his mouth. There, one of them kept a close watch over him, and if the honour of the noble family required that the adven- ture should have a tragic ending, it was easy to end everything with one of those poisons which leave no trace; then, they would say that he had died a natural death, and would take his dead body back to his room. Carried away by his own story like a dramatic author, Julien was really afraid when he entered the dining-room. He looked at all the ser- vants in full livery. He studied their expressions. 'Which of them have been chosen for tonight's expedition?' he asked himself. 'In this family, the memories of the Court of Henri in are so present, so often recalled, that, when they think themselves outraged, they will show more de- cision than other people of their rank.' He looked at Mademoiselle de La Mole in order to read in her eyes what were the plans of her family; she was pale, and had quite a mediaeval appearance. Never had he found such an air of grandeur in her, she was truly beautiful and imposing. He almost fell in love with her. 'Pallida morte futura,' he told himself, 'her pal- lor betokens that something serious is afoot.' In vain, after dinner, did he prolong his stroll in the garden, Ma- demoiselle de La Mole did not come out. Conversation with her would, at that moment, have relieved his heart of a great burden. Why not confess it? He was afraid. As he was determined to act, he abandoned himself to this sentiment without shame. 'Provided that at the moment of action, I find the courage that I require,' he said to him- self, 'what does it matter how I may be feeling now?' He went to recon- noitre the position and to try the weight of the ladder. 'It is an instrument,' he said to himself, with a laugh, 'which it is writ- ten in my destiny that I am to use! Here as at Verrieres. What a differ- ence! Then,' he continued with a sigh, 'I was not obliged to be suspicious of the person for whose sake I was exposing myself. What a difference, too, in the danger! 'I might have been killed in M. de Renal's gardens without any harm to my reputation. It would have been easy to make my death unaccount- able. Here, what abominable tales will they not bandy about in the drawing-rooms of the Hotel de Chaulnes, the Hotel de Caylus, the Hotel

de Retz, and in short everywhere? I shall be handed down to posterity as a monster. 'For two or three years,' he added, laughing at himself. But the thought of this overwhelmed him. 'And I, who is going to justify me? Supposing that Fouque prints my posthumous pamphlet, it will be only an infamy the more. What! I am received in a house, and in payment for the hospit- ality I receive there, the kindness that is showered upon me, I print a pamphlet reporting all that goes on in the house! I attack the honour of its women! Ah, a thousand times rather, let us be trapped!' It was a terrible evening.

Chapter One o'Clock in the Morning The garden was extremely large, laid out with perfect taste just a few years previously. But the trees were over a century old. The place had something rustic about it. MASSINGER 14 He was on the point of countermanding his instructions to Fouque when the clock struck eleven. He came out of his bedroom and shut the door behind him, turning the key noisily in the lock, as though he were locking himself in. He prowled round the house to see what was afoot everywhere, especially on the fourth floor, where the servants slept. There was nothing unusual. One of Madame de La Mole's maids was giving a party, the servants were merrily imbibing punch. 'The men who are laughing like that,' thought Julien, 'cannot have been detailed for the midnight encounter, they would be more serious.' Finally he took his stand in a dark corner of the garden. 'If their plan is to avoid the notice of the servants of the house, they will make the men they have hired to seize me come in over the garden wall. 'If M. de Croisenois is taking all this calmly, he must feel that it will be less compromising for the young person whom he intends to marry to have me seized before the moment when I shall have entered her room.' He made an extremely careful military reconnaissance. 'My honour is at stake,' he thought; 'if I make some blunder, it will be no excuse in my own eyes to say to myself: "I never thought of that."' The sky was maddeningly clear. About eleven o'clock the moon rose, at half-past twelve it lighted the whole garden front of the house. 'She is mad,' Julien said to himself; when one o'clock struck, there was still a light in Comte Norbert's windows. Never in his life had Julien 14.I have left this motto untranslated, as the attribution to Massinger seems to be en- tirely fantastic. C. K. S. M.

been so much afraid, he saw only the dangers of the enterprise, and felt not the least enthusiasm. He went to fetch the huge ladder, waited five minutes, to allow time for a countermand, and at five minutes past one placed the ladder against Mathilde's window. He climbed quietly, pistol in hand, aston- ished not to find himself attacked. As he reached the window, she opened it silently: 'Here you are, Sir,' Mathilde said to him with deep emotion; 'I have been following your movements for the last hour.' Julien was greatly embarrassed, he did not know how to behave, he did not feel the least vestige of love. In his embarrassment, he decided that he must show courage, he attempted to embrace Mathilde. 'Fie, Sir!' she said, and thrust him from her. Greatly relieved at this repulse, he hastened to cast an eye round the room: the moonlight was so brilliant that the shadows which it formed in Mademoiselle de La Mole's room were black. 'There may easily be men concealed there without my seeing them,' he thought. 'What have you in the side pocket of your coat?' Mathilde asked him, delighted at finding a topic of conversation. She was strangely ill at ease; all the feelings of reserve and timidity, so natural to a young girl of good family, had resumed their sway and were keeping her on tenter-hooks. 'I have all sorts of weapons and pistols,' replied Julien, no less pleased at having something to say. 'You must pull up the ladder,' said Mathilde. 'It is huge, and may break the windows of the room below, or of the mezzanine.' 'It must not break the windows,' Mathilde went on, trying in vain to adopt the tone of ordinary conversation; 'you might, it seems to me, let the ladder down by means of a cord tied to the top rung. I always keep a supply of cords by me.' 'And this is a woman in love!' thought Julien, 'she dares to say that she loves! Such coolness, such sagacity in her precautions make it plain to me that I am not triumphing over M. de Croisenois, as I foolishly ima- gined; but am simply becoming his successor. After all, what does it mat- ter? I am not in love! I triumph over the Marquis in this sense, that he will be greatly annoyed at having a successor, and still more annoyed that his successor should be myself. How arrogantly he stared at me last night in the Cafe Tortoni, pretending not to know me! How savagely he bowed to me afterwards, when he could no longer avoid it!'

Julien had fastened the cord to the highest rung of the ladder, he now let it down gently, leaning far out over the balcony so as to see that it did not touch the windows. 'A fine moment for killing me,' he thought, 'if there is anyone hidden in Mathilde's room'; but a profound silence con- tinued to reign everywhere. The head of the ladder touched the ground. Julien succeeded in con- cealing it in the bed of exotic flowers that ran beneath the wall. 'What will my mother say,' said Mathilde, 'when she sees her beautiful plants all ruined! You must throw down the cord,' she went on, with per- fect calm. 'If it were seen running up to the balcony, it would be difficult to explain its presence.' 'And how me gwine get way?' asked Julien, in a playful tone, imitating Creole speech. (One of the maids in the house was a native of San Domingo.) 'You get way by the door,' said Mathilde, delighted at this solution. 'Ah! How worthy this man is of all my love,' she thought. Julien had just let the cord drop into the garden; Mathilde gripped him by the arm. He thought he was being seized by an enemy, and turned sharply round drawing a dagger. She thought she had heard a window being opened. They stood motionless, without breathing. The moon shone full upon them. As the sound was not repeated, there was no fur- ther cause for alarm. Then their embarrassment began again, and was great on both sides. Julien made sure that the door was fastened with all its bolts; he even thought of looking under the bed, but dared not; they might have hidden a footman or two there. Finally, the fear of a subsequent reproach from his prudence made him look. Mathilde had succumbed to all the agonies of extreme shyness. She felt a horror of her position. 'What have you done with my letters?' she said, at length. 'What a fine opportunity to discomfit these gentlemen, if they are listening, and so avoid the conflict!' thought Julien. 'The first is hidden in a stout Protestant Bible which last night's mail has carried far from here.' He spoke very distinctly as he entered into these details, and in such a way as to be overheard by anyone who might be concealed in two great mahogany wardrobes which he had not dared to examine. 'The other two are in the post, and are going the same way as the first.' 'Good Lord! But why all these precautions?' said Mathilde, with astonishment.

'Is there any reason why I should lie to her?' thought Julien; and he confessed to her all his suspicions. 'So that accounts for the coldness of thy letters!' cried Mathilde, in ac- cents rather of frenzy than of affection. Julien did not observe her change of tone. This use of the singular pro- noun made him lose his head, or at least his suspicions vanished; he ven- tured to clasp in his arms this girl who was so beautiful and inspired such respect in him. He was only half repulsed. He had recourse to his memory, as once before, long ago, at Besancon with Amanda Binet, and repeated several of the finest passages from the Nouvelle Heloise. 'Thou hast a man's heart,' she replied, without paying much attention to what he was saying; 'I wished to test thy bravery, I admit. Thy first suspicions and thyu determination to come shew thee to be even more intrepid than I supposed.' Mathilde made an effort to use the more intimate form; she was evid- ently more attentive to this unusual way of speaking than to what she was saying. This use of the tu form, stripped of the tone of affection, ceased, after a moment, to afford Julien any pleasure, he was astonished at the absence of happiness; finally, in order to feel it, he had recourse to his reason. He saw himself highly esteemed by this girl who was so proud, and never bestowed unrestricted praise; by this line of reasoning he arrived at a gratification of his self-esteem. This was not, it is true, that spiritual ecstasy which he had found at times in the company of Madame de Renal. There was nothing tender in his sentiments at this first moment. What he felt was the keenest gratific- ation of his ambition, and Julien was above all things ambitious. He spoke again of the people he suspected and of the precautions he had contrived. As he spoke he was thinking of how best to profit by his victory. Mathilde, who was still greatly embarrassed and had the air of one ap- palled by what she had done, seemed enchanted at finding a topic of conversation. They discussed how they should meet again. Julien em- ployed to the full the intelligence and daring of which he furnished fresh proofs in the course of this discussion. They had some extremely sharp- sighted people against them, young Tanbeau was certainly a spy, but Mathilde and he were not altogether incompetent either. What could be easier than to meet in the library, and arrange everything?

'I can appear, without arousing suspicion, in any part of the house, I could almost appear in Madame de La Mole's bedroom.' It was abso- lutely necessary to pass through this room to reach her daughter's. If Mathilde preferred that he should always come by a ladder, it was with a heart wild with joy that he would expose himself to this slight risk. As she listened to him speaking, Mathilde was shocked by his air of triumph. 'He is my master, then!' she told herself. Already she was de- voured by remorse. Her reason felt a horror of the signal act of folly which she had just committed. Had it been possible, she would have des- troyed herself and Julien. Whenever, for an instant, the strength of her will made her remorse silent, feelings of shyness and outraged modesty made her extremely wretched. She had never for a moment anticipated the dreadful plight in which she now found herself. 'I must speak to him, though,' she said to herself, finally, 'that is laid down in the rules, one speaks to one's lover.' And then, as though per- forming a duty, and with a tenderness that was evident rather in the words that she used than in the sound of her voice, she told him of the various decisions to which she had come with regard to him during the last few days. She had made up her mind that if he ventured to come to her with the aid of the gardener's ladder, as she had bidden him, she would give her- self to him. But never were things so tender said in a colder and more formal tone. So far, their intercourse was ice-bound. It was enough to make one hate the thought of love. What a moral lesson for a rash young woman! Is it worth her while to wreck her future for such a moment? After prolonged uncertainties, which might have appeared to a super- ficial observer to be due to the most decided hatred, so hard was it for the feeling of self-respect which a woman owes to herself, to yield to so masterful a will, Mathilde finally became his mistress. To tell the truth, their transports were somewhat deliberate. Passionate love was far more a model which they were imitating than a reality with them. Mademoiselle de La Mole believed that she was performing a duty to- wards herself and towards her lover. 'The poor boy,' she told herself, 'has been the last word in daring, he deserves to be made happy, or else I am wanting in character.' But she would gladly have redeemed at the cost of an eternity of suffering the cruel necessity to which she found herself committed. In spite of the violence she was doing to herself, she retained entire command of her speech.

No regret, no reproach came to mar this night which seemed odd rather than happy to Julien. What a difference, great God, from his last visit, of twenty-four hours, to Verrieres! 'These fine Paris manners have found out the secret of spoiling everything, even love,' he said to himself with an extreme disregard of justice. He abandoned himself to these reflections, standing upright in one of the great mahogany wardrobes into which he had been thrust at the first sound heard from the next room, which was Madame de La Mole's bed- room. Mathilde accompanied her mother to mass, the maids soon left the apartment, and Julien easily made his escape before they returned to complete their labours. He mounted his horse and made at a leisurely pace for the most solit- ary recesses of one of the forests near Paris. He was still more surprised than happy. The happiness which, from time to time, came flooding into his heart, was akin to that of a young Second Lieutenant who, after some astounding action, has just been promoted Colonel by the Commander in Chief; he felt himself carried to an immense height. Everything that had been above him the day before was now on his level or far beneath him. Gradually Julien's happiness increased as he put the miles behind him. If there was nothing tender in his heart, it was because, strange as it may appear, Mathilde, throughout the whole of her conduct with him, had been performing a duty. There was nothing unforeseen for her in all the events of this night but the misery and shame which she had found in the place of that utter bliss of which we read in novels. 'Can I have been mistaken? Am I not in love with him?' she asked herself.

Chapter An Old Sword I now mean to be serious:—it is time, Since laughter nowadays is deem'd too serious. A jest at Vice by Virtue's call'd a crime. Don Juan, XIII. She did not appear at dinner. In the evening she came to the drawing- room for a moment, but did not look at Julien. This behaviour seemed to him strange; 'but,' he thought, 'I do not know the ways of good society, she will give me some good reason for all this.' At the same time, urged by the most intense curiosity, he studied the expression on Mathilde's features; he could not conceal from himself that she had a sharp and malevolent air. Evidently this was not the same woman who, the night before, had felt or pretended to feel transports of joy too excessive to be genuine. Next day, and the day after, the same coldness on her part; she never once looked at him, she seemed unaware of his existence. Julien, de- voured by the keenest anxiety, was a thousand leagues from the feeling of triumph which alone had animated him on the first day. 'Can it, by any chance,' he asked himself, 'be a return to the path of virtue?' But that was a very middle-class expression to use of the proud Mathilde. 'In the ordinary situations of life she has no belief in religion,' thought Julien; 'she values it as being very useful to the interests of her caste. 'But out of simple delicacy may she not be bitterly reproaching herself with the mistake that she has made?' Julien assumed that he was her first lover. 'But,' he said to himself at other moments, 'one must admit that there is nothing artless, simple, tender, in her attitude; never have I seen her looking so haughty. Can she despise me? It would be like her to re- proach herself with what she has done for me, solely on account of my humble birth.' While Julien, steeped in the prejudices he had derived from books and from memories of Verrieres, was pursuing the chimera of a tender

mistress who never gives a thought to her own existence the moment she has gratified the desires of her lover, Mathilde in her vanity was furious with him. As she had ceased to be bored for the last two months, she was no longer afraid of boredom; so, albeit he could not for a moment suspect it, Julien was deprived of his strongest advantage. 'I have given myself a master!' Mademoiselle de La Mole was saying to herself, in the grip of the blackest despond. 'He may be the soul of hon- our; but if I goad his vanity to extremes, he will have his revenge by making public the nature of our relations.' Mathilde had never had a lov- er, and at this epoch in life, which gives certain tender illusions to even the most sterile hearts, she was a prey to the bitterest reflections. 'He has an immense power over me, since he reigns by terror and can inflict a fearful punishment on me if I drive him to extremes.' This idea, by itself, was enough to provoke Mathilde to insult him. Courage was the fundamental quality in her character. Nothing was capable of giving her any excitement and of curing her of an ever-present tendency to boredom, but the idea that she was playing heads or tails with her whole existence. On the third day, as Mademoiselle de La Mole persisted in not looking at him, Julien followed her after dinner, to her evident annoyance, into the billiard room. 'Well, Sir; you must imagine yourself to have acquired some very powerful hold over me,' she said to him, with ill-controlled rage, 'since in opposition to my clearly expressed wishes, you insist on speaking to me? Are you aware that nobody in the world has ever been so presumptuous?' Nothing could be more entertaining than the dialogue between these two lovers; unconsciously they were animated by a mutual sentiment of the keenest hatred. As neither of them had a consistent nature, as moreover they were used to the ways of good society, it was not long be- fore they both declared in plain terms that they had quarrelled for ever. 'I swear to you eternal secrecy,' said Julien; 'I would even add that I will never address a word to you again, were it not that your reputation might be injured by too marked a change.' He bowed respectfully and left her. He performed without undue difficulty what he regarded as a duty; he was far from imagining himself to be deeply in love with Mademois- elle de La Mole. No doubt he had not been in love with her three days earlier, when he had been concealed in the great mahogany wardrobe.

But everything changed rapidly in his heart from the moment when he saw himself parted from her for ever. His pitiless memory set to work reminding him of the slightest incid- ents of that night which in reality had left him so cold. During the very night after their vow of eternal separation, Julien nearly went mad when he found himself forced to admit that he was in love with Mademoiselle de La Mole. A ghastly conflict followed this discovery: all his feelings were thrown into confusion. Two days later, instead of being haughty with M. de Croisenois, he could almost have burst into tears and embraced him. The force of continued unhappiness gave him a glimmer of common sense; he decided to set off for Languedoc, packed his trunk and went to the posting house. He almost fainted when, on reaching the coach office, he was informed that, by mere chance, there was a place vacant next day in the Toulouse mail. He engaged it and returned to the Hotel de La Mole to warn the Marquis of his departure. M. de La Mole had gone out. More dead than alive, Julien went to wait for him in the library. What were his feelings on finding Mademoiselle de La Mole there? On seeing him appear, she assumed an air of malevolence which it was impossible for him to misinterpret, Carried away by his misery, dazed by surprise, Julien was weak enough to say to her, in the tenderest of tones and one that sprang from the heart: 'Then, you no longer love me?' 'I am horrified at having given myself to the first comer,' said Math- ilde, weeping with rage at herself. 'To the first comer!' cried Julien, and he snatched up an old mediaeval sword which was kept in the library as a curiosity. His grief, which he had believed to be intense at the moment of his speaking to Mademoiselle de La Mole, had now been increased an hun- dredfold by the tears of shame which he saw her shed. He would have been the happiest of men had it been possible to kill her. Just as he had drawn the sword, with some difficulty, from its anti- quated scabbard, Mathilde, delighted by so novel a sensation, advanced proudly towards him; her tears had ceased to flow. The thought of the Marquis de La Mole, his benefactor, arose vividly in Julien's mind. 'I should be killing his daughter!' he said to himself; 'how horrible!' He made as though to fling away the sword. 'Certainly,'

he thought, 'she will now burst out laughing at the sight of this melodra- matic gesture': thanks to this consideration, he entirely regained his self- possession. He examined the blade of the old sword with curiosity, and as though he were looking for a spot of rust, then replaced it in its scab- bard, and with the utmost calm hung it up on the nail of gilded bronze from which he had taken it. This series of actions, very deliberate towards the end, occupied fully a minute; Mademoiselle de La Mole gazed at him in astonishment. 'So I have been within an inch of being killed by my lover!' she said to herself. This thought carried her back to the bravest days of the age of Charles IX and Henri III. She stood motionless before Julien who had now replaced the sword, she gazed at him with eyes in which there was no more hatred. It must be admitted that she was very attractive at that moment, certainly no woman had ever borne less resemblance to a Parisian doll (this label ex- pressed Julien's chief objection to the women of that city). 'I am going to fall back into a fondness for him,' thought Mathilde; 'and then at once he would suppose himself to be my lord and master, after a relapse, and at the very moment when I have just spoken to him so firmly.' She fled. 'My God! How beautiful she is!' said Julien, as he watched her run from the room: 'that is the creature who flung herself into my arms with such frenzy not a week ago ... And those moments will never come again! And it is my fault! And, at the moment of so extraordinary an ac- tion, and one that concerned me so closely, I was not conscious of it! ... I must admit that I was born with a very dull and unhappy nature.' The Marquis appeared; Julien made haste to inform him of his departure. 'For where?' said M. de La Mole. 'For Languedoc.' 'No, if you please, you are reserved for a higher destiny; if you go any- where, it will be to the North ... Indeed, in military parlance, I confine you to your quarters. You will oblige me by never being absent for more than two or three hours, I may need you at any moment.' Julien bowed, and withdrew without uttering a word, leaving the Marquis greatly astonished; he was incapable of speech, and shut him- self up in his room. There, he was free to exaggerate all the iniquity of his lot. 'And so,' he thought, 'I cannot even go away! God knows for how many days the Marquis is going to keep me in Paris; great God! What is

to become of me? And not a friend that I can consult; the abbe Pirard would not let me finish my first sentence, Conte Altamira would offer to enlist me in some conspiracy. 'And meanwhile I am mad, I feel it; I am mad! 'Who can guide me, what is to become of me?'

Chapter Painful Moments And she admits it to me! She goes into the minutest details! Her lovely eye fixed on mine reveals the love that she felt for another! SCHILLER Mademoiselle de La Mole, in an ecstasy, could think only of the felicity of having come within an inch of being killed. She went so far as to say to herself: 'He is worthy to be my master, since he has been on the point of killing me. How many of the good-looking young men in society would one have to fuse together to arrive at such an impulse of passion? 'One must admit that he did look handsome when he climbed on the chair, to replace the sword, precisely in the picturesque position which the decorator had chosen for it! After all, I was not such a fool to fall in love with him.' At that moment, had any honourable way of renewing their relations presented itself, she would have seized it with pleasure. Julien, locked and double-locked in his room, was a prey to the most violent despair. In the height of his folly, he thought of flinging himself at her feet. If, in- stead of remaining hidden in a remote corner, he had wandered through the house and into the garden, so as to be within reach of any opportun- ity, he might perhaps in a single instant have converted his fearful misery into the keenest happiness. But the adroitness with the want of which we are reproaching him would have debarred the sublime impulse of seizing the sword which, at that moment, made him appear so handsome in the eyes of Mademois- elle de La Mole. This caprice, which told in Julien's favour, lasted for the rest of the day; Mathilde formed a charming impression of the brief mo- ments during which she had loved him, and looked back on them with regret. 'Actually,' she said to herself, 'my passion for that poor boy lasted, in his eyes, only from one o'clock in the morning, when I saw him arrive by his ladder, with all his pistols in the side pocket of his coat, until eight. It

was at a quarter past eight, when hearing mass at Sainte-Valere, that it first occurred to me that he would imagine himself to be my master, and might try to make me obey him by force of terror.' After dinner, Mademoiselle de La Mole, far from avoiding Julien, spoke to him, and almost ordered him to accompany her to the garden; he obeyed. This proved too much for her self-control. Mathilde yielded, almost unconsciously, to the love which she began to feel for him. She found an intense pleasure in strolling by his side, it was with curiosity that she gazed at his hands which that morning had seized the sword to kill her. After such an action, after all that had passed, there could no longer be any question of their conversing on the same terms as before. Gradually Mathilde began to talk to him with an intimate confidence of the state of her heart. She found a strange delight in this kind of con- versation; she proceeded to tell him of the fleeting impulses of enthusi- asm which she had felt for M. de Croisenois, for M. de Caylus ... 'What! For M. de Caylus as well!' cried Julien; and all the bitter jeal- ousy of a past jilted lover was made manifest in his words. Mathilde re- ceived them in that light, and was not offended. She continued to torture Julien, detailing her past feelings in the most picturesque fashion, and in accents of the most absolute sincerity. He saw that she was describing what was present before her eyes. He had the grief of remarking that as she spoke she made fresh discoveries in her own heart. The agony of jealousy can go no farther. The suspicion that a rival is loved is painful enough already, but to have the love that he inspires in her confessed to one in detail by the wo- man whom one adores is without doubt the acme of suffering. Oh, how she punished, at that moment, the impulse of pride which had led Julien to set himself above all the Caylus and Croisenois! With what an intense and heartfelt misery he now exaggerated their most trivial advantages! With what ardent sincerity he now despised himself! Mathilde seemed adorable to him, language fails to express the intens- ity of his admiration. As he walked by her side, he cast furtive glances at her hands, her arms, her regal bearing. He was on the point of falling at her feet, crushed with love and misery, and crying: 'Pity!' 'And this creature who is so lovely, so superior to all the rest, who has once loved me, it is M. de Caylus whom, no doubt, she will presently be loving!'

Julien could not doubt Mademoiselle de La Mole's sincerity; the accent of truth was all too evident in everything that she said. That absolutely nothing might be wanting to complete his misery, there were moments when, by dint of occupying her mind with the sentiments which she had at one time felt for M. de Caylus, Mathilde was led to speak of him as though she loved him still. Certainly there was love in her accents, Julien could see it plainly. Had his bosom been flooded with a mass of molten lead, he would have suffered less. How, arrived at this extreme pitch of misery, was the poor boy to guess that it was because she was talking to him that Ma- demoiselle de La Mole found such pleasure in recalling all the niceties of love that she had felt in the past for M. de Caylus or M. de Luz? No words could express Julien's anguish. He was listening to the de- tailed confidences of the love felt for others in that same lime walk where, so few days since, he had waited for one o'clock to strike before making his way into her room. Human nature is incapable of enduring misery at a higher pitch than this. This kind of cruel intimacy lasted for a whole week. Mathilde now ap- peared to seek, now did not shun opportunities of speaking to him; and the subject of conversation, to which they seemed both to return with a sort of torturing pleasure, was the recital of the sentiments that she had felt for others; she recounted to him the letters that she had written, told him the very words of them, repeated whole sentences. On the final days she seemed to be studying Julien with a sort of malignant delight. His sufferings were a source of keen enjoyment to her. We can see that Julien had no experience of life, he had not even read any novels; if he had been a little less awkward, and had said with a cer- tain coldness to this girl, whom he so adored and who made him such strange confidences: 'Admit that though I am not the equal of all these gentlemen, it is still myself that you love ... ' Perhaps she would have been glad to have her secret guessed; at any rate his success would have depended entirely upon the grace with which Julien expressed this idea, and the moment that he chose. However that might be, he came out well, and yith advantage to himself, from a situation which was tending to become monotonous in Mathilde's eyes. 'And you no longer love me, me who adore you!' Julien said |o her one day, desperate with love and misery. It was almost She worst blun- der that he could have made.

This speech destroyed in an instant all the pleasure that lademoiselle de La Mole found in speaking to him of the state of her heart. She was beginning to feel astonished that after what had happened he did not take offence at her confidences, he was on the point of imagining, at the moment when he made this foolish speech, that perhaps he no longer loved her. 'Pride has doubtless quenched his love,' she said to herself. 'He is not the man to see himself set with impunity beneath creatures like Caylus, de Luz, Croisenois, who he admits are so far his superiors. No, I shall never see him at my feet again!' On the preceding days, in the artlessness of his misery, Julien had paid a heartfelt tribute to the brilliant qualities of these gentlemen; he went so far as to exaggerate them. This change of attitude had by no means es- caped the notice of Mademoiselle de La Mole; it had surprised her, but she did not suspect the reason or it. Julien's frenzied soul, in praising a rival whom he believed to be loved, sympathised with that rival in his good fortune. This speech, so frank but so stupid, altered the whole situation an in- stant: Mathilde, certain of being loved, despised him completely. She was strolling with him at the moment of this unfortunate utter- ance; she left him, and her final glance was expressive of the most bitter scorn. Returning to the drawing-room, for the rest of the evening she never looked at him again. Next day, this scorn of him had entire posses- sion of her heart; there was no longer any question of the impulse which, for a whole week, had made her find such pleasure in treating Julien as her most intimate friend; the sight of him was repulsive to her. Mathilde's feeling reached the point of disgust; no words could express the intensity of the scorn that she felt when her eyes happened to fall on him. Julien had understood nothing of all that had been happening in Mathilde's heart, but for the past week he discerned her scorn. He had the good sense to appear in her presence as rarely as possible, and never looked her in the face. But it was not without a mortal anguish that he deprived himself to some extent of her company. He thought he could feel that his misery was thereby actually increased. 'The courage of a man's heart can go no farther,' he told himself. He spent all his time at a little window in the at- tics of the house; the shutters were carefully closed, and from there, at least, he could catch a glimpse of Mademoiselle de La Mole when she ap- peared in the garden.

What were his feelings when, after dinner, he saw her strolling with M. de Caylus, M. de Luz or any of the others for whom she had avowed some slight amorous inclination in the past? Julien had had no idea of such an intensity of misery; he was on the point of crying aloud; that resolute heart was at last reduced to utter helplessness. Any thought that was not of Mademoiselle de La Mole had become odious to him; he was incapable of writing the most simple letters. 'You are crazy,' the Marquis said to him. Julien, trembling with fear of a disclosure, pleaded illness and man- aged to make himself believed. Fortunately for him, the Marquis teased him at dinner over his coming journey: Mathilde gathered that it might be prolonged. For several days now Julien had been avoiding her, and the brilliant young men who had everything that was lacking in this creature so pale and sombre, once loved by her, had no longer the power to distract her from her dreams. 'An ordinary girl,' she said to herself, 'would have sought for the man of her choice among the young fellows who attract every eye in a drawing-room; but one of the characteristics of genius is not to let its thoughts move in the rut traced by the common herd. 'As the partner of such a man as Julien, who lacks nothing but the for- tune which I possess, I shall continue to attract attention, I shall by no means pass unperceived through life. So far from incessantly dreading a Revolution like my cousins, who, in their fear of the people, dare not scold a postilion who drives them badly, I shall be certain of playing a part and a great part, for the man of my choice has character and an un- bounded ambition. What does he lack? Friends? Money? I can give him all that.' But in her thoughts she treated Julien rather as an inferior being who can be made to love one when one wills.

Chapter The Opera-Bouffe O how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day; Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by and by a cloud takes all away! SHAKESPEARE Occupied with thoughts of the future and of the singular part which she hoped to play, Mathilde soon came to look back with regret upon the dry, metaphysical discussions which she often had with Julien. Wearied with keeping her thoughts on so high a plane, sometimes also she would sigh for the moments of happiness which she had found in his company; these memories were not untouched by remorse, which at certain mo- ments overwhelmed her. 'But if one has a weakness,' she said to herself, 'it is incumbent upon a girl like myself to forget her duties only for a man of merit; people will not be able to say that it was his handsome moustaches or his elegant seat on a horse that seduced me, but his profound discussions of the fu- ture in store for France, his ideas as to the resemblance the events that are going to burst upon us may bear to the Revolution of 1688 in Eng- land. I have been seduced,' she answered the voice of remorse, 'I am a weak woman, but at least I have not been led astray like a puppet by out- ward advantages. 'If there be a Revolution, why should not Julien Sorel play the part of Roland, and I that of Madame Roland? I prefer that to the part of Ma- dame de Stael: immoral conduct will be an obstacle in our time. Cer- tainly they shall not reproach me with a second lapse; I should die of shame.' Mathilde's meditations were not all as grave, it must be admitted, as the thoughts we have just transcribed. She would look at Julien, and found a charming grace in his most trivi- al actions.

'No doubt,' she said to herself, 'I have succeeded in destroying every idea in his mind that he has certain rights. 'The air of misery and profound passion with which the poor boy ad- dressed those words of love to me a week ago, is proof positive; I must confess that it was extraordinary in me to be vexed by a speech so fer- vent with respect and passion. Am I not his wife? That speech was only natural, and, I am bound to say, quite agreeable. Julien still loved me after endless conversations, in which I had spoken to him, and with great cruelty, I admit, only of the feelings of love which the boredom of the life I lead had inspired in me for the young men in society of whom he is so jealous. Ah, if he knew how little danger there is in them for me! How lifeless they seem to me when compared with him, all copies of each other.' As she made these reflections, Mathilde was tracing lines with a pencil at random on a page of her album. One of the profiles as she finished it startled and delighted her: it bore a striking resemblance to Julien. 'It is the voice of heaven! This is one of the miracles of love,' she cried in a transport, 'quite unconsciously I have drawn his portrait.' She fled to her room, locked herself in, set to work, tried seriously to make a portrait of Julien, but could not succeed; the profile drawn at ran- dom was still the best likeness. Mathilde was enchanted; she saw in it a clear proof of her grand passion. She did not lay aside her album until late in the evening, when the Marquise sent for her to go to the Italian opera. She had only one idea, to catch Julien's eye, so as to make her mother invite him to join them. He did not appear; the ladies had only the most commonplace people in their box. During the whole of the first act of the opera, Mathilde sat dreaming of the man whom she loved with transports of the most in- tense passion; but in the second act a maxim of love sung, it must be ad- mitted, to a melody worthy of Cimarosa, penetrated her heart. The heroine of the opera said: 'I must be punished for all the adoration that I feel for him, I love him too well!' The moment she had heard this sublime cantilena, everything that exis- ted in the world vanished from Mathilde's ken. People spoke to her; she did not answer; her mother scolded her, it was all she could do to look at her. Her ecstasy reached a state of exaltation and passion comparable to the most violent emotions that, during the last few days, Julien had felt for her. The cantilena, divinely graceful, to which was sung the maxim that seemed to her to bear so striking an application to her own situation, occupied every moment in which she was not thinking directly of Julien.

Thanks to her love of music, she became that evening as Madame de Renal invariably was when thinking of him. Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthu- siasm; it knows itself too well, it criticises itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. On her return home, in spite of anything that Madame de La Mole might say, Mathilde alleged an attack of fever, and spent part of the night playing over the cantilena on her piano. She sang the words of the famous aria which had charmed her: Devo punirmi, devo punirmi, Se troppo amai. The result of this night of madness was that she imagined herself to have succeeded in conquering her love. (This page will damage the un- fortunate author in more ways than one. The frigid hearts will accuse it of indecency. It does not offer the insult to the young persons who shine in the drawing-rooms of Paris, of supposing that a single one of their number is susceptible to the mad impulses which degrade the character of Mathilde. This character is wholly imaginary, and is indeed imagined quite apart from the social customs which among all the ages will assure so distinguished a place to the civilisation of the nineteenth century. It is certainly not prudence that is lacking in the young ladies who have been the ornament of the balls this winter. Nor do I think that one can accuse them of unduly despising a brilliant fortune, horses, fine properties, and everything that ensures an agreeable position in society. So far from their seeing nothing but boredom in all these advantages, they are as a rule the object of their most constant de- sires, and if there is any passion in their hearts it is for them. Neither is it love that provides for the welfare of young men endowed with a certain amount of talent like Julien; they attach themselves insep- arably to a certain set, and when the set 'arrives', all the good things of society rain upon them. Woe to the student who belongs to no set, even his minute and far from certain successes will be made a reproach to him, and the higher virtue will triumph over him as it robs him. Ah, Sir, a novel is a mirror carried along a high road. At one moment it reflects to your vision the azure skies, at another the mire of the puddles at your feet. And the man who carries this mirror in his pack will be accused by you of being immoral! His mirror shows the mire, and you blame the mirror! Rather blame that high road upon which the puddle lies, still more the inspector of roads who allows the water to gather and the puddle to form.

Now that it is quite understood that the character of Mathilde is im- possible in our age, no less prudent than virtuous, I am less afraid of causing annoyance by continuing the account of the follies of this charm- ing girl.) Throughout the whole of the day that followed she looked out for op- portunities to assure herself that she had indeed conquered her insane passion. Her main object was to displease Julien in every way; but none of her movements passed unperceived by him. Julien was too wretched and above all, too greatly agitated, to inter- pret so complicated a stratagem of passion, still less could he discern all the promise that it held out to himself: he fell a victim to it; never per- haps had his misery been so intense. His actions were so little under the control of his mind that if some morose philosopher had said to him: 'Seek to take advantage rapidly of a disposition which for the moment is favourable to you; in this sort of brain-fed love, which we see in Paris, the same state of mind cannot continue for more than a couple of days,' he would not have understood. But, excited as he might be, Julien had a sense of honour. His first duty was discretion; so much he did under- stand. To ask for advice, to relate his agony to the first comer would have been a happiness comparable to that of the wretch who, crossing a burning desert, receives from the sky a drop of ice-cold water. He was aware of the danger, he was afraid of answering with a torrent of tears the indiscreet person who should question him; he closeted himself in his room. He saw Mathilde strolling late and long in the garden; when at length she had left it, he went down there; he made his way to a rose tree from which she had plucked a rose. The night was dark, he could indulge the full extent of his misery without fear of being seen. It was evident to him that Mademoiselle de La Mole was in love with one of those young officers to whom she had been chattering so gaily. He himself had been loved by her, but she had seen how slight were his merits. 'And indeed, they are slight!' Julien told himself with entire conviction; 'I am, when all is said, a very dull creature, very common, very tedious to others, quite insupportable to myself.' He was sick to death of all his own good qualities, of all the things that he had loved with enthusiasm; and in this state of inverted imagination he set to work to criticise life with his imagination. This is an error that stamps a superior person.

More than once the idea of suicide occurred to him; this image was full of charm, it was like a delicious rest; it was the glass of ice-cold water offered to the wretch who, in the desert, is dying of thirst and heat. 'My death will increase the scorn that she feels for me!' he exclaimed. 'What a memory I shall leave behind me!' Sunk into the nethermost abyss of misery, a human being has no re- source left but courage. Julien had not wisdom enough to say to himself: 'I must venture all'; but as he looked up at the window of Mathilde's room, he could see through the shutters that she was putting out her light: he pictured to himself that charming room which he had seen, alas, once only in his life. His imagination went no farther. One o'clock struck; from hearing the note of the bell to saying to him- self: 'I am going up by the ladder,' did not take a moment. This was a flash of genius, cogent reasons followed in abundance. 'Can I possibly be more wretched?' he asked himself. He ran to the ladder, the gardener had made it fast with a chain. With the hammer of one of his pocket pistols, which he broke, Julien, animated for the moment by a su- perhuman force, wrenched open one of the iron links of the chain which bound the ladder; in a few minutes it was free, and he had placed it against Mathilde's window. 'She will be angry, will heap contempt upon me, what of that? I give her a kiss, a final kiss, I go up to my room and kill myself... ; my lips will have touched her cheek before I die!' He flew up the ladder, tapped at the shutter; a moment later Mathilde heard him, she tried to open the shutter, the ladder kept it closed. Julien clung to the iron latch intended to hold the shutter open, and, risking a thousand falls, gave the ladder a violent shake, and displaced it a little. Mathilde was able to open the shutter. He flung himself into the room more dead than alive: 'So it is you!' she said, and fell into his arms ... What words can describe the intensity of Julien's happiness? Mathilde's was almost as great. She spoke to him against herself, she accused herself to him. 'Punish me for my atrocious pride,' she said to him, squeezing him in her arms as though to strangle him; 'you are my master, I am your slave, I must beg pardon upon my knees for having sought to rebel.' She slipped from his embrace to fall at his feet. 'Yes, you are my master,' she said again, intoxicated with love and joy; 'reign over me for ever, punish your slave severely when she seeks to rebel.'

In another moment she had torn herself from his arms, lighted the candle, and Julien had all the difficulty in the world in preventing her from cutting off all one side of her hair. 'I wish to remind myself,' she told him, 'that I am your servant: should my accursed pride ever make me forget it, show me these locks and say: "There is no question now of love, we are not concerned with the emo- tion that your heart may be feeling at this moment, you have sworn to obey, obey upon your honour."' But it is wiser to suppress the description of so wild a felicity. Julien's chivalry was as great as his happiness; 'I must go down now by the ladder,' he said to Mathilde, when he saw the dawn appear over the distant chimneys to the east, beyond the gardens. The sacrifice that I am imposing on myself is worthy of you, I am depriving myself of some hours of the most astounding happiness that a human soul can enjoy, it is a sacrifice that I am offering to your reputation: if you know my heart you appreciate the effort that I have to make. Will you always be to me what you are at this moment? But the voice of honour speaks, it is enough. Let me tell you that, since our first meeting, suspicion has not been directed only against robbers. M. de La Mole has set a watch in the garden. M. de Croisenois is surrounded by spies, we know what he is, doing night by night ... ' When she heard this idea, Mathilde burst out laughing. Her mother and one of the maids were aroused: immediately they called to her through the door. Julien looked at her, she turned pale as she scolded the maid, and did not condescend to speak to her mother. 'But if it should occur to them to open the window, they will see the ladder!' Julien said to her. He clasped her once more in his arms, sprang on to the ladder and slid rather than climbed down it; in a moment he was on the ground. Three seconds later the ladder was under the lime alley, and Mathilde's honour was saved. Julien, on recovering his senses, found himself bleeding copiously and half naked: he had cut himself in his headlong descent. The intensity of his happiness had restored all the energy of his nature: had a score of men appeared before him, to attack them single-handed would, at that moment, have been but a pleasure the more. Fortunately, his martial valour was not put to the proof: he laid down the ladder in its accustomed place; he replaced the chain that fastened it; he did not for- get to come back and obliterate the print which the ladder had left in the border of exotic flowers beneath Mathilde's window.

As in the darkness he explored the loose earth with his hand, to make sure that the mark was entirely obliterated, he felt something drop on his hand; it was a whole side of Mathilde's hair which she had clipped and threw down to him. She was at her window. 'See what your servant sends you,' she said in audible tones, 'it is the sign of eternal obedience. I renounce the exercise of my own reason; be my master.' Julien, overcome, was on the point of fetching back the ladder and mounting again to her room. Finally reason prevailed. To enter the house from the garden was by no means easy. He suc- ceeded in forcing the door of a cellar; once in the house he was obliged to break open, as silently as possible, the door of his own room. In his con- fusion he had left everything behind, including the key, which was in the pocket of his coat. 'Let us hope,' he thought, 'that she will remember to hide all that corpus delicti!' Finally exhaustion overpowered happiness, and, as the sun rose, he fell into a profound slumber. The luncheon bell just succeeded in waking him, he made his appear- ance in the dining-room. Shortly afterwards, Mathilde entered the room. Julien's pride tasted a momentary joy when he saw the love that glowed in the eyes of this beautiful creature, surrounded by every mark of defer- ence; but soon his prudence found an occasion for alarm. On the pretext of not having had time to dress her hair properly, Mathilde had so arranged it that Julien could see at a glance the whole extent of the sacrifice that she had made for him in clipping her locks that night. If anything could have spoiled so lovely a head, Mathilde would have succeeded in spoiling hers; all one side of those beautiful pale golden locks were cropped to within half an inch of her scalp. At luncheon, Mathilde's whole behaviour was in keeping with this ori- ginal imprudence. You would have said that she was deliberately trying to let everyone see the insane passion that she had for Julien. For- tunately, that day, M. de La Mole and the Marquise were greatly taken up with a list of forthcoming promotions to the Blue Riband, in which the name of M. de Chaulnes had not been included. Towards the end of the meal, Mathilde in talking to Julien addressed him as 'my master'. He coloured to the whites of his eyes. Whether by accident or by the express design of Madame de La Mole, Mathilde was not left alone for an instant that day. In the evening,

however, as she passed from the dining-room to the drawing-room, she found an opportunity of saying to Julien: 'I hope you do not think that it is my idea: Mamma has just decided that one of her maids is to sleep in my room.' The day passed like lightning; Julien was on the highest pinnacle of happiness. By seven o'clock next morning he was installed in the library; he hoped that Mademoiselle de La Mole would deign to appear there; he had written her an endless letter. He did not see her until several hours had passed, at luncheon. Her head was dressed on this occasion with the greatest pains; a marvellous art had been employed to conceal the gap left by the clipped locks. She looked once or twice at Julien, but with polite, calm eyes; there was no longer any question of her calling him 'my master'. Julien could not breathe for astonishment ... Mathilde found fault with herself for almost everything that she had done for him. On mature reflection, she had decided that he was a creature, if not al- together common, at any rate not sufficiently conspicuous to deserve all the strange follies which she had ventured to commit for him. On the whole, she no longer thought of love; she was tired of love that day. As for Julien, the emotions of his heart were those of a boy of sixteen. Harrowing doubt, bewilderment, despair, seized upon him by turns dur- ing this luncheon, which seemed to him to be everlasting. As soon as he could decently rise from table, he flew rather than ran to the stable, saddled his horse himself and was off at a gallop; he was afraid of disgracing himself by some sign of weakness. 'I must kill my heart by physical exhaustion,' he said to himself as he galloped through the woods of Meudon. 'What have I done, what have I said to deserve such disgrace? 'I must do nothing, say nothing today,' he decided as he returned to the house, 'be dead in body as I am in spirit. Julien no longer lives, it is his corpse that is still stirring.'

Chapter The Japanese Vase His heart does not at first realise the whole extent of his misery: he is more disturbed than moved. But in proportion as his reason returns, he feels the depth of his misfortune. All the pleasures in life are as nothing to him, he can feel only the sharp points of the despair that is rending him. But what is the good of speaking of physical pain? What pain felt by the body alone is comparable to this? JEAN-PAUL The dinner bell rang, Julien had barely time to dress; he found Math- ilde in the drawing-room urging her brother and M. de Croisenois not to go and spend the evening with Madame la Marechale de Fervaques. She could hardly have been more seductive and charming with them. After dinner they were joined by M. de Luz, M. de Caylus and several of their friends. One would have said that Mademoiselle de La Mole had resumed, together with the observance of sisterly affection, that of the strictest conventions. Although the weather that evening was charming, she insisted that they should not go out to the garden; she was determ- ined not to be lured away from the armchair in which Madame de La Mole was enthroned. The blue sofa was the centre of the group, as in winter. Mathilde was out of humour with the garden, or at least it seemed to her to be utterly boring: it was associated with the memory of Julien. Misery destroys judgment. Our hero made the blunder of clinging to that little cane chair which in the past had witnessed such brilliant tri- umphs. This evening, nobody spoke to him; his presence passed as though unperceived or worse. Those of Mademoiselle de La Mole's friends who were seated near him at the end of the sofa made an affecta- tion of turning their backs on him, or so he thought. 'It is a courtier's disgrace,' he concluded. He decided to study for a mo- ment the people who were trying to crush him with their disdain.

M. de Luz's uncle held an important post in the King's Household, the consequence of which was that this gallant officer opened his conversa- tion with each fresh arrival with the following interesting detail: His uncle had set off at seven o'clock for Saint-Cloud, and expected to spend the night there. This piece of news was introduced in the most casual manner, but it never failed to come out. Upon observing M. de Croisenois with the severe eye of misery, Julien remarked the enormous influence which this worthy and amiable young man attributed to occult causes. So much so that he became moody and cross if he heard an event of any importance set down to a simple and quite natural cause. 'There is a trace of madness there,' Julien told him- self. 'This character bears a striking resemblance to that of the Emperor Alexander, as Prince Korasoff described him to me.' During the first year of his stay in Paris, poor Julien, coming fresh from the Seminary, dazzled by the graces, so novel to him, of all these agreeable young men, could do nothing but admire them. Their true character was only now begin- ning to outline itself before his eyes. 'I am playing an undignified part here,' he suddenly decided. The next thing was how to leave his little cane chair in a fashion that should not be too awkward. He tried to think of one, he called for something origin- al upon an imagination that was fully occupied elsewhere. He was ob- liged to draw upon his memory, which, it must be confessed, was by no means rich in resources of this order; the boy was still a thorough novice, so that his awkwardness was complete and attracted everyone's atten- tion when he rose to leave the drawing-room. Misery was all too evident in his whole deportment. He had been playing the part for three quarters of an hour of a troublesome inferior from whom people do not take the trouble to conceal what they think of him. The critical observations which he had been making at the expense of his rivals prevented him, however, from taking his misfortune too seri- ously; he retained, to give support to his pride, the memory of what had occurred the night before last. 'Whatever the advantages they may have over me,' he thought as he went into the garden by himself, 'Mathilde has not been to any of them what, on two occasions in my life, she has deigned to be to me.' His sagacity went no farther. He failed entirely to understand the char- acter of the singular person whom chance had now made absolute mis- tress of his whole happiness. He devoted the next day to killing himself and his horse with exhaus- tion. He made no further attempt, that evening, to approach the blue sofa

to which Mathilde was faithful. He remarked that Comte Norbert did not so much as deign to look at him when they met in the house. 'He must be making an extraordinary effort,' he thought, 'he who is naturally so polite.' For Julien, sleep would have meant happiness. Despite his bodily ex- haustion, memories of a too seductive kind began to invade his whole imagination. He had not the intelligence to see that by his long rides through the forests round Paris, acting only upon himself and in no way upon the heart or mind of Mathilde, he was leaving the arrangement of his destiny to chance. It seemed to him that one thing would supply boundless comfort to his grief: namely to speak to Mathilde. And yet what could he venture to say to her? This was the question upon which one morning at seven o'clock he was pondering deeply, when suddenly he saw her enter the library. 'I know, Sir, that you desire to speak to me.' 'Great God! Who told you that?' 'I know it, what more do you want? If you are lacking in honour, you may ruin me, or at least attempt to do so; but this danger, which I do not regard as real, will certainly not prevent me from being sincere. I no longer love you, Sir; my wild imagination misled me ... ' On receiving this terrible blow, desperate with love and misery, Julien tried to excuse himself. Nothing could be more absurd. Does one excuse oneself for failing to please? But reason no longer held any sway over his actions. A blind instinct urged him to postpone the decision of his fate. It seemed to him that so long as he was still speaking, nothing was defin- itely settled. Mathilde did not listen to his words, the sound of them irrit- ated her, she could not conceive how he had the audacity to interrupt her. The twofold remorse of her virtue and her pride made her, that morn- ing, equally unhappy. She was more or less crushed by the frightful idea of having given certain rights over herself to a little cleric, the son of a peasant. 'It is almost,' she told herself in moments when she exaggerated her distress, 'as though I had to reproach myself with a weakness for one of the footmen.' In bold and proud natures, it is only a step from anger with oneself to fury with other people; one's transports of rage are in such circumstances a source of keen pleasure. In a moment, Mademoiselle de La Mole reached the stage of heaping on Julien the marks of the most intense scorn. She had infinite cleverness,

and this cleverness triumphed in the art of torturing the self-esteem of others and inflicting cruel wounds upon them. For the first time in his life, Julien found himself subjected to the action of a superior intelligence animated by the most violent hatred of himself. So far from entertaining the slightest idea of defending himself at that moment, he began to despise himself. Hearing her heap upon him such cruel marks of scorn, so cleverly calculated to destroy any good opinion that he might have of himself, he felt that Mathilde was right, and that she was not saying enough. As for her, her pride found an exquisite pleasure in thus punishing herself and him for the adoration which she had felt a few days earlier. She had no need to invent or to think for the first time of the cruel words which she now uttered with such complacence. She was only re- peating what for the last week had been said in her heart by the counsel of the opposite party to love. Every word increased Julien's fearful misery an hundredfold. He tried to escape, Mademoiselle de La Mole held him by the arm with a gesture of authority. 'Please to observe,' he said to her, 'that you are speaking extremely loud; they will hear you in the next room.' 'What of that!' Mademoiselle de La Mole retorted proudly, 'who will dare to say to me that he has heard me? I wish to rid your petty self-es- teem for ever of the ideas which it may have formed of me.' When Julien was able to leave the library, he was so astounded that he already felt his misery less keenly. 'Well! She no longer loves me,' he re- peated to himself, speaking aloud as though to inform himself of his pos- ition. 'It appears that she loved me for a week or ten days, and I shall love her all my life. 'Is it really possible, she meant nothing, nothing at all to my heart, only a few days ago.' The delights of satisfied pride flooded Mathilde's bosom; so she had managed to break with him for ever! The thought of so complete a tri- umph over so strong an inclination made her perfectly happy. 'And so this little gentleman will understand, and once for all, that he has not and never will have any power over me.' She was so happy that really she had ceased to feel any love at that moment. After so atrocious, so humiliating a scene, in anyone less passionate than Julien, love would have become impossible. Without departing for a single instant from what she owed to herself, Mademoiselle de La Mole had addressed to him certain of those disagreeable statements, so well

calculated that they can appear to be true, even when one remembers them in cold blood. The conclusion that Julien drew at the first moment from so astonish- ing a scene was that Mathilde had an unbounded pride. He believed firmly that everything was at an end for ever between them, and yet, the following day, at luncheon, he was awkward and timid in her presence. This was a fault that could not have been found with him until then. In small matters as in great, he knew clearly what he ought and wished to do, and carried it out. That day, after luncheon, when Madame de La Mole asked him for a seditious and at the same time quite rare pamphlet, which her parish priest had brought to her secretly that morning, Julien, in taking it from a side table, knocked over an old vase of blue porcelain, the ugliest thing imaginable. Madame de La Mole rose to her feet with a cry of distress and came across the room to examine the fragments of her beloved vase. 'It was old Japan,' she said, 'it came to me from my great-aunt the Abbess of Chelles; it was a present from the Dutch to the Duke of Orleans when he was Re- gent and he gave it to his daughter ... ' Mathilde had followed her mother, delighted to see the destruction of this blue vase which seemed to her horribly ugly. Julien stood silent and not unduly distressed; he saw Mademoiselle de La Mole standing close beside him. 'This vase,' he said to her, 'is destroyed for ever; so is it with a senti- ment which was once the master of my heart; I beg you to accept my apologies for all the foolish things it has made me do'; and he left the room. 'Really, one would think,' said Madame de La Mole as he went, 'that this M. Sorel is proud and delighted with what he has done.' This speech fell like a weight upon Mathilde's heart. 'It is true,' she told herself, 'my mother has guessed aright, such is the sentiment that is an- imating him.' Then and then only ended her joy in the scene that she had made with him the day before. 'Ah, well, all is at an end,' she said to her- self with apparent calm; 'I am left with a great example; my mistake has been fearful, degrading! It will make me wise for all the rest of my life.' 'Was I not speaking the truth?' thought Julien; 'why does the love that I felt for that madwoman torment me still?' This love, so far from dying, as he hoped, was making rapid strides. 'She is mad, it is true,' he said to himself, 'but is she any less adorable? Is it possible for a girl to be more lovely? Everything that the most elegant

civilisation can offer in the way of keen pleasures, was it not all com- bined to one's heart's content in Mademoiselle de La Mole?' These memories of past happiness took possession of Julien, and rapidly undid all the work of reason. Reason struggles in vain against memories of this sort; its stern en- deavours serve only to enhance their charm. Twenty-four hours after the breaking of the old Japanese vase, Julien was decidedly one of the unhappiest of men.

Chapter The Secret Note For I saw everything that I am telling you; and if I may have been deceived when I saw it, I am most certainly not deceiving you in telling you of it. From a Letter to the Author The Marquis sent for him; M. de La Mole seemed rejuvenated, there was a gleam in his eye. 'Let us hear a little about your memory,' he said to Julien. 'I am told it is prodigious! Could you learn four pages by heart and go and repeat them in London? But without altering a word!' The Marquis was feverishly turning the pages of that morning's Quoti- dienne, and seeking in vain to dissimulate a highly serious air, which Juli- en had never seen him display, not even when they were discussing the Frilair case. Julien had by this time sufficient experience to feel that he ought to ap- pear thoroughly deceived by the light manner that was being assumed for his benefit. 'This number of the Quotidienne is perhaps not very amusing; but, if M. le Marquis will allow me, tomorrow morning I shall have the honour to recite it to him from beginning to end.' 'What! Even the advertisements?' 'Literally, and without missing a word.' 'Do you give me your word for that?' went on the Marquis with a sud- den gravity. 'Yes, Sir, only the fear of not keeping it might upset my memory.' 'What I mean is that I forgot to ask you this question yesterday; I do not ask you on your oath never to repeat what you are about to hear; I know you too well to insult you in that way. I have answered for you, I am going to take you to a room where there will be twelve persons as- sembled; you will take note of what each of them says.

'Do not be uneasy, it is not going to be a confused conversation, each one will speak in his turn, I do not mean a set speech,' the Marquis went on, resuming the tone of careless superiority which came so naturally to him. 'While we are talking, you will write down twenty pages or so; you will return here with me, we shall cut down those twenty pages to four. It is those four pages that you shall recite to me tomorrow morning in- stead of the whole number of the Quotidienne. You will then set off at once; you will have to take post like a young man who is travelling for his pleasure. Your object will be to pass unobserved by anyone. You will arrive in the presence of a great personage. There, you will require more skill. It will be a question of taking in everyone round him; for among his secretaries, among his servants, there are men in the pay of our enemies, who lie in wait for our agents to intercept them. You shall have a formal letter of introduction. When His Excellency looks at you, you will take out my watch here, which I am going to lend you for the journey. Take it now, while you are about it, and give me yours. 'The Duke himself will condescend to copy out at your dictation the four pages which you will have learned by heart. 'When this has been done, but not before, remember, you may, if His Excellency questions you, give him an account of the meeting which you are now about to attend. 'One thing that will prevent you from feeling bored on your jorney is that between Paris and the residence of the Minister there are people who would ask for nothing better than to fire a shot at M. l'abbe Sorel. Then his mission is at an end and I foresee a long delay; for, my dear fel- low, how shall we hear of your death? Your zeal cannot go so far as to inform us of it. 'Run off at once and buy yourself a complete outfit,' the Marquis went on with a serious air. 'Dress in the style of the year before last. This even- ing you will have to look a little shabby. On the journey, however, you will dress as usual. Does that surprise you, does your suspicious mind guess the reason? Yes, my friend, one of the venerable personages whom you are about to hear discuss is fully capable of transmitting information by means of which someone may quite possibly administer opium to you, if nothing worse, in the evening, in some respectable inn at which you will have called for supper.' 'It would be better,' said Julien, 'to travel thirty leagues farther and avoid the direct route. My destination is Rome, I suppose ... ' The Marquis assumed an air of haughty displeasure which Julien had not seen to so marked a degree since Bray-le-Haut.

'That is what you shall learn, Sir, when I think fit to tell you. I do not like questions.' 'It was not a question,' replied Julien effusively: 'I swear to you, Sir, I was thinking aloud, I was seeking in my own mind the safest route.' 'Yes, it seems that your thoughts were far away. Never forget that an ambassador, one of your youth especially, ought not to appear to be for- cing confidences.' Julien was greatly mortified, he was in the wrong. His self-esteem sought for an excuse and could find none. 'Understand then,' M. de La Mole went on, 'that people always appeal to their hearts when they have done something foolish.' An hour later, Julien was in the Marquis's waiting-room in the garb of an inferior, with old-fashioned clothes, a doubtfully clean neckcloth and something distinctly smug about his whole appearance. At the sight of him, the Marquis burst out laughing, and then only was Julien's apology accepted. 'If this young man betrays me,' M. de La Mole asked himself, 'whom can I trust? And yet when it comes to action, one has to trust somebody. My son and his brilliant friends of the same kidney have honest hearts, and loyalty enough for a hundred thousand; if it were a question of fighting, they would perish on the steps of the throne, they know everything ... except just what is required at the moment. Devil take me if I can think of one of them who could learn four pages by heart and travel a hundred leagues without being tracked. Norbert would know how to let himself be killed like his ancestors, but any conscript can do that ... ' The Marquis fell into a profound meditation: 'And even being killed,' he said with a sigh, 'perhaps this Sorel would manage that as well as he ... 'The carriage is waiting,' said the Marquis, as though to banish a vexa- tious thought. 'Sir,' said Julien, 'while they were altering this coat for me, I committed to memory the first page of today's Quotidienne.' The Marquis took the paper, Julien repeated the page without a single mistake. 'Good,' said the Marquis, every inch the diplomat that evening; 'meanwhile this young man is not observing the streets through which we are passing.' They arrived in a large room of a distinctly gloomy aspect, partly pan- elled and partly hung in green velvet. In the middle of the room, a scowl- ing footman had just set up a large dinner-table, which he proceeded to

convert into a writing table, by means of an immense green cloth covered with ink stains, a relic of some Ministry. The master of the house was a corpulent man whose name was never uttered; Julien decided that his expression and speech were those of a man engaged in digestion. At a sign from the Marquis, Julien had remained at the lower end of the table. To avoid drawing attention to himself he began to point the quills. He counted out of the corner of his eye seven speakers, but he could see nothing more of them than their backs. Two of them appeared to him to be addressing M. de La Mole on terms of equality, the others seemed more or less deferential. Another person entered the room unannounced. 'This is strange,' thought Julien, 'no one is announced in this room. Can this precaution have been taken in my honour?' Everyone rose to receive the newcomer. He was wearing the same extremely distinguished decoration as three of the men who were already in the room. They spoke in low tones. In judging the newcomer, Julien was restricted to what he could learn from his features and dress. He was short and stout, with a high complexion and a gleaming eye devoid of any expression beyond the savage glare of a wild boar. Julien's attention was sharply distracted by the almost immediate ar- rival of a wholly different person. This was a tall man, extremely thin and wearing three or four waistcoats. His eye was caressing, his gestures polished. 'That is just the expression of the old Bishop of Besancon,' thought Juli- en. This man evidently belonged to the Church, he did not appear to be more than fifty or fifty-five, no one could have looked more fatherly. The young Bishop of Agde appeared, and seemed greatly surprised when, in making a survey of those present, his eye rested on Julien. He had not spoken to him since the ceremony at Bray-le-Haut. His look of surprise embarrassed and irritated Julien. 'What,' the latter said to him- self, 'is knowing a man to be always to my disadvantage? All these great gentlemen whom I have never seen before do not frighten me in the least, and the look in this young Bishop's eyes freezes me! It must be ad- mitted that I am a very strange and very unfortunate creature.' A small and extremely dark man presently made a noisy entrance, and began speaking from the door; he had a sallow complexion and a slightly eccentric air. On the arrival of this pitiless talker, groups began to form, apparently to escape the boredom of listening to him.

As they withdrew from the fireplace they drew near to the lower end of the table, where Julien was installed. His expression became more and more embarrassed, for now at last, in spite of all his efforts, he could not avoid hearing them, and however slight his experience might be, he real- ised the full importance of the matters that were being discussed without any attempt at concealment; and yet how careful the evidently exalted personages whom he saw before him ought to be to keep them secret. Already, working as slowly as possible, Julien had pointed a score of quills; this resource must soon fail him. He looked in vain for an order in the eyes of M. de La Mole; the Marquis had forgotten him. 'What I am doing is absurd,' thought Julien as he pointed his pens; 'but people who are so commonplace in appearance, and are entrusted by others or by themselves with such high interests, must be highly suscept- ible. My unfortunate expression has a questioning and scarcely respect- ful effect which would doubtless annoy them. If I lower my eyes too far I shall appear to be making a record of their talk.' His embarrassment was extreme, he was hearing some strange things said.

Chapter The Discussion The republic—for every person today willing to sacrifice all to the common good, there are thousands and millions who know only their own pleasures and their vanity. One is esteemed in Paris for one's carriage, not for one's virtue. NAPOLEON, Memorial The footman burst in, announcing: 'Monsieur le Duc de ——.' 'Hold your tongue, you fool,' said the Duke as he entered the room. He said this so well, and with such majesty that Julien could not help think- ing that knowing how to lose his temper with a footman was the whole extent of this great personage's knowledge. Julien raised his eyes and at once lowered them again. He had so clearly divined the importance of this new arrival that he trembled lest his glance should be thought an indiscretion. This Duke was a man of fifty, dressed like a dandy, and treading as though on springs. He had a narrow head with a large nose, and a curved face which he kept thrusting forward. It would have been hard for anyone to appear at once so noble and so insignificant. His coming was a signal for the opening of the discussion. Julien was sharply interrupted in his physiognomical studies by the voice of M. de La Mole. 'Let me present to you M. l'abbe Sorel,' said the Marquis. 'He is endowed with an astonishing memory; it was only an hour ago that I spoke to him of the mission with which he might perhaps be honoured, and, in order to furnish us with a proof of his memory, he has learned by heart the first page of the Quotidienne.' 'Ah! The foreign news, from poor N ——,' said the master of the house. He picked up the paper eagerly and, looking at Julien with a whimsical air, in the effort to appear important: 'Begin, Sir,' he said to him. The silence was profound, every eye was fixed on Julien; he repeated his lesson so well that after twenty lines: 'That will do,' said the Duke.

The little man with the boar's eyes sat down. He was the chairman for, as soon as he had taken his place, he indicated a card table to Julien, and made a sign to him to bring it up to his side. Julien established himself there with writing materials. He counted twelve people seated round the green cloth. 'M. Sorel,' said the Duke, 'retire to the next room. We shall send for you.' The master of the house assumed an uneasy expression. 'The shutters are not closed,' he murmured to his neighbour. 'It is no use your looking out of the window,' he foolishly exclaimed to Julien. 'Here I am thrust in- to a conspiracy at the very least,' was the latter's thought. 'Fortunately, it is not one of the kind that end on the Place de Greve. Even if there were danger, I owe that and more to the Marquis. I should be fortunate, were it granted me to atone for all the misery which my follies may one day cause him!' Without ceasing to think of his follies and of his misery, he studied his surroundings in such a way that he could never forget them. Only then did he remember that he had not heard the Marquis tell his footman the name of the street, and the Marquis had sent for a cab, a thing he never did. Julien was left for a long time to his reflections. He was in a parlour hung in green velvet with broad stripes of gold. There was on the side- table a large ivory crucifix, and on the mantelpiece the book Du Pape, by M. de Maistre, with gilt edges, and magnificently bound. Julien opened it so as not to appear to be eavesdropping. Every now and then there was a sound of raised voices from the next room. At length the door opened, his name was called. 'Remember, Gentlemen,' said the chairman, 'that from this moment we are addressing the Duc de ——. This gentleman,' he said, pointing to Julien, 'is a young Levite, devoted to our sacred cause, who will have no difficulty in repeating, thanks to his astonishing memory, our most trivi- al words. 'Monsieur has the floor,' he said, indicating the personage with the fatherly air, who was wearing three or four waistcoats. Julien felt that it would have been more natural to call him the gentleman with the waist- coats. He supplied himself with paper and wrote copiously. (Here the author would have liked to insert a page of dots. 'That will not look pretty,' says the publisher, 'and for so frivolous a work not to look pretty means death.'

'Politics,' the author resumes, 'are a stone attached to the neck of liter- ature, which, in less than six months, drowns it. Politics in the middle of imaginative interests are like a pistol-shot in the middle of a concert. The noise is deafening without being emphatic. It is not in harmony with the sound of any of the instruments. This mention of politics is going to give deadly offence to half my readers, and to bore the other half, who have already found far more interesting and emphatic politics in their morn- ing paper.' 'If your characters do not talk politics,' the publisher retorts, 'they are no longer Frenchmen of 1830, and your book ceases to hold a mirror, as you claim... .') Julien's report amounted to twenty-six pages; the following is a quite colourless extract; for I have been obliged, as usual, to suppress the ab- surdities, the frequency of which would have appeared tedious or highly improbable. (Compare the Gazette des Tribunaux. ) The man with the waistcoats and the fatherly air (he was a Bishop, perhaps), smiled often, and then his eyes, between their tremulous lids, assumed a strange brilliance and an expression less undecided than was his wont. This personage, who was invited to speak first, before the Duke ('but what Duke?' Julien asked himself), apparently to express opinions and to perform the functions of Attorney General, appeared to Julien to fall into the uncertainty and absence of definite conclusions with which those officers are often reproached. In the course of the dis- cussion the Duke went so far as to rebuke him for this. After several phrases of morality and indulgent philosophy, the man with the waistcoats said: 'Noble England, guided by a great man, the immortal Pitt, spent forty thousand million francs in destroying the Revolution. If this assembly will permit me to express somewhat boldly a melancholy reflection, Eng- land does not sufficiently understand that with a man like Bonaparte, es- pecially when one had had to oppose to him only a collection of good in- tentions, there was nothing decisive save personal measures ... ' 'Ah! Praise of assassination again!' said the master of the house with an uneasy air. 'Spare us your sentimental homilies,' exclaimed the chairman angrily; his boar's eye gleamed with a savage light. 'Continue,' he said to the man with the waistcoats. The chairman's cheeks and brow turned purple. 'Noble England,' the speaker went on, 'is crushed today, for every Eng- lishman, before paying for his daily bread, is obliged to pay the interest

on the forty thousand million francs which were employed against the Jacobins. She has no longer a Pitt ... ' 'She has the Duke of Wellington,' said a military personage who as- sumed an air of great importance. 'Silence, please, Gentlemen,' cried the chairman; 'if we continue to dis- agree, there will have been no use in our sending for M. Sorel.' 'We know that Monsieur is full of ideas,' said the Duke with an air of vexation and a glance at the interrupter, one of Napoleon's Generals. Julien saw that this was an allusion to something personal and highly of- fensive. Everyone smiled; the turncoat General seemed beside himself with rage. 'There is no longer a Pitt,' the speaker went on, with the discouraged air of a man who despairs of making his hearers listen to reason. 'Were there a fresh Pitt in England, one does not hoodwink a nation twice by the same means ... ' 'That is why a conquering General, a Bonaparte is impossible now in France,' cried the military interrupter. On this occasion, neither the chairman nor the Duke dared show an- noyance, though Julien thought he could read in their eyes that they were tempted to do so. They lowered their eyes, and the Duke contented himself with a sigh loud enough to be audible to them all. But the speaker had lost his temper. 'You are in a hurry for me to conclude,' he said with heat, entirely dis- carding that smiling politeness and measured speech which Julien had assumed to be the natural expression of his character: 'you are in a hurry for me to conclude; you give me no credit for the efforts that I am mak- ing not to offend the ears of anyone present, however long they may be. Very well, Gentlemen, I shall be brief. 'And I shall say to you in the plainest of words: England has not a half- penny left for the service of the good cause. Were Pitt to return in person, with all his genius he would not succeed in hoodwinking the small landowners of England, for they know that the brief campaign of Water- loo cost them, by itself, one thousand million francs. Since you wish for plain speaking,' the speaker added, growing more and more animated, 'I shall say to you: Help yourselves, for England has not a guinea for your assistance, and if England does not pay, Austria, Russia, Prussia, which have only courage and no money, cannot support more than one cam- paign or two against France. 'You may hope that the young soldiers collected by Jacobinism will be defeated in the first campaign, in the second perhaps; but in the third

(though I pass for a revolutionary in your prejudiced eyes), in the third you will have the soldiers of 1794, who were no longer the recruited peasants of 1792.' Here the interruption broke out in three or four places at once. 'Sir,' said the chairman to Julien, 'go and make a fair copy in the next room of the first part of the report which you have taken down.' Julien left the room with considerable regret. The speaker had referred to prob- abilities which formed the subject of his habitual meditations. 'They are afraid of my laughing at them,' he thought. When he was re- called, M. de La Mole was saying, with an earnestness, which, to Julien, who knew him, seemed highly amusing: 'Yes, Gentlemen, it is above all of this unhappy race that one can say: "Shall it be a god, a table or a bowl?" '"It shall be a god!" cries the poet. It is to you, Gentlemen, that this say- ing, so noble and so profound, seems to apply. Act for yourselves, and our noble France will reappear more or less as our ancestors made her and as our own eyes beheld her before the death of Louis XVI. 'England, her noble Lords at least, curses as heartily as we ignoble Ja- cobinism: without English gold, Austria, Russia, Prussia cannot fight more than two or three battles. Will that suffice to bring about a glorious occupation, like that which M. de Richelieu squandered so stupidly in 1817? I do not think so.' At this point an interruption occurred, but it was silenced by a general murmur. It arose once more from the former Imperial General, who de- sired the Blue Riband, and was anxious to appear among the compilers of the secret note. 'I do not think so,' M. de La Mole resumed after the disturbance. He dwelt upon the word 'I' with an insolence which charmed Julien. 'That is well played,' he said to himself as he made his pen fly almost as fast as the Marquis's utterance. With a well-placed word, M. de La Mole anni- hilated the twenty campaigns of the turncoat. 'It is not to foreigners alone,' the Marquis continued in the most meas- ured tone, 'that we can remain indebted for a fresh military occupation. That youthful band who contribute incendiary articles to the Globe will provide you with three or four thousand young captains, among whom may be found a Kleber, a Hoche, a Jourdan, a Pichegru, but less well- intentioned.' 'We did wrong in not crowning him with glory,' said the chairman, 'we ought to have made him immortal.'

'There must, in short, be two parties in France,' went on M. de La Mole, 'but two parties, not in name only, two parties clearly defined, sharply divided. Let us be certain whom we have to crush. On one side the journalists, the electors, public opinion; in a word, youth and all those who admire it. While it is dazed by the sound of its own idle words, we, we have the certain advantage of handling the budget.' Here came a fresh interruption. 'You, Sir,' M. de La Mole said to the interrupter with a supercilious ease that was quite admirable, 'you do not handle, since the word ap- pears to shock you, you devour forty thousand francs borne on the state budget and eighty thousand which you receive from the Civil List. 'Very well, Sir, since you force me to it, I take you boldly as an ex- ample. Like your noble ancestors who followed Saint Louis to the Cru- sade, you ought, for those hundred and twenty thousand francs, to let us see at least a regiment, a company, shall I say a half-company, were it composed only of fifty men ready to fight, and devoted to the good cause, alive or dead. You have only footmen who, in the event of a re- volt, would frighten nobody but yourself. The Throne, the Altar, the Nobility may perish any day, Gentlemen, so long as you have not created in each Department a force of five hundred devoted men; devoted, I mean, not only with all the gallantry of France but with the constancy of Spain. 'One half of this troop will have to be composed of our sons, our neph- ews, in short of true gentlemen. Each of them will have by his side, not a glib little cockney ready to hoist the striped cockade if another 1815 should arrive, but an honest peasant, simple and open like Cathelineau; our gentleman will have trained him, it should be his foster-brother, if possible. Let each of us sacrifice the fifth part of his income to form this little devoted troop of five hundred men to a Department. Then you may count upon a foreign occupation. Never will the foreign soldier cross our borders as far as Dijon even, unless he is certain of finding five hundred friendly soldiers in each Department. 'The foreign Kings will listen to you only when you can inform them that there are twenty thousand gentlemen ready to take up arms to open to them the gates of France. This service is arduous, you will say. Gentle- men, it is the price of our heads. Between the liberty of the press and our existence as gentlemen, there is war to the knife. Become manufacturers, peasants, or take up your guns. Be timid if you like, but do not be stupid. Open your eyes.

'Form your battalions, I say to you, in the words of the Jacobin song; then there will appear some noble Gustavus-Adolphus, who, moved by the imminent peril to the monarchical principle will come flying three hundred leagues beyond his borders, and do for you what Gustavus did for the Protestant princes. Do you propose to go on talking without act- ing? In fifty years there will be nothing in Europe but Presidents of Re- publics, not one King left. And with those four letters K-I-N-G, go the priests and the gentlemen. I can see nothing but candidates paying court to draggletailed majorities. 'It is no use your saying that France has not at this moment a trust- worthy General, known and loved by all, that the army is organised only in the interests of Throne and Altar, that all the old soldiers have been discharged from it, whereas each of the Prussian and Austrian regiments includes fifty non-commissioned officers who have been under fire. 'Two hundred thousand young men of the middle class are in love with the idea of war... .' 'Enough unpleasant truths,' came in a tone of importance from a grave personage, apparently high on the ladder of ecclesiastical preferment, for M. de La Mole smiled pleasantly instead of showing annoyance, which was highly significant to Julien. 'Enough unpleasant truths; Gentlemen, to sum up: the man with whom it was a question of amputating his gangrened leg would be ill- advised to say to his surgeon: this diseased leg is quite sound. Pardon me the simile, Gentlemen, the noble Duke of —— is our surgeon.' 15 'There is the great secret out at last,' thought Julien; 'it is to the —— that I shall be posting tonight.' 15.The Duke of Wellington.

Chapter The Clergy, their Forests, Liberty The first law for every creature is that of self-preservation, of life. You sow hemlock, and expect to see the corn ripen! MACHIAVELLI The grave personage continued; one could see that he knew; he set forth with a gentle and moderate eloquence, which vastly delighted Juli- en, the following great truths: (1) England has not a guinea at our service; economy and Hume are the fashion there. Even the Saints will not give us any money, and Mr Brougham will laugh at us. (2,) Impossible to obtain more than two campaigns from the Monarchs of Europe, without English gold; and two campaigns will not be enough against the middle classes. (3) Necessity of forming an armed party in France, otherwise the mon- archical principle in the rest of Europe will not risk even those two campaigns. 'The fourth point which I venture to suggest to you as self-evident is this: 'The impossibility of forming an armed party in France without the Clergy. I say it to you boldly, because I am going to prove it to you, Gentlemen. We must give the Clergy everything: '(i) Because, occupying themselves with their own business night and day, and guided by men of high capacity established out of harm's way three hundred leagues from your frontiers ... ' 'Ah! Rome! Rome!' exclaimed the master of the house ... 'Yes, Sir, Rome!' the Cardinal answered proudly. 'Whatever be the more or less ingenious pleasantries which were in fashion when you were young, I will proclaim boldly, in 1830, that the Clergy, guided by Rome, speak and speak alone to the lower orders. 'Fifty thousand priests repeat the same words on the day indicated by their leaders, and the people, who, after all, furnish the soldiers, will be

more stirred by the voice of their priests than by all the cheap poems in the world... .' (This personal allusion gave rise to murmurs.) 'The Clergy have an intellect superior to yours,' the Cardinal went on, raising his voice; 'all the steps that you have taken towards this essential point, having an armed party here in France, have been taken by us.' Here facts were cited. Who had sent eighty thousand muskets to the Vendee? and so forth. 'So long as the Clergy are deprived of their forests, they have no ten- ure. At the first threat of war, the Minister of Finance writes to his agents that there is no more money except for the parish priests. At heart, France is not religious, and loves war. Whoever it be that gives her war, he will be doubly popular, for to make war is to starve the Jesuits, in vul- gar parlance; to make war is to deliver those monsters of pride, the French people, from the menace of foreign intervention.' The Cardinal had a favourable hearing ... 'It was essential,' he said, 'that M. de Nerval should leave the Ministry, his name caused needless irritation.' Upon this, they all rose to their feet and began speaking at once. 'They will be sending me out of the room again,' thought Julien; but the prudent chairman himself had forgotten Julien's presence and indeed his existence. Every eye turned to a man whom Julien recognised. It was M. de Ner- val, the First Minister, whom he had seen at the Duc de Retz's ball. The disorder was at its height, as the newspapers say, when reporting the sittings of the Chamber. After fully a quarter of an hour, silence began to be restored. Then M. de Nerval rose and, adopting the tone of an Apostle: 'I shall not for one moment pretend,' he said, in an unnatural voice, 'that I am not attached to office. 'It has been proved to me, Gentlemen, that my name doubles the strength of the Jacobins by turning against us a number of moderate men. I should willingly resign, therefore; but the ways of the Lord are visible to but a small number; but,' he went on, looking fixedly at the Cardinal, 'I have a mission; heaven has said to me: "You shall lay down your head on the scaffold, or you shall reestablish the Monarchy in France, and reduce the Chambers to what Parliament was under Louis XV," and that, Gentlemen, I will do.' He ceased, sat down, and a great silence fell. 'There is a good actor,' thought Julien. He made the mistake, then as always, of crediting people with too much cleverness.

Animated by the debates of so lively an evening, and above all by the sincerity of the discussion, at that moment M. de Nerval believed in his mission. With his great courage the man did not combine any sense. Midnight struck during the silence that followed the fine peroration 'that I will do'. Julien felt that there was something imposing and funereal in the sound of the clock. He was deeply moved. The discussion soon began again with increasing energy and above all with an incredible simplicity. 'These men will have me poisoned,' thought Julien, at certain points. 'How can they say such things before a plebeian?' Two o'clock struck while they were still talking. The master of the house had long been asleep; M. de La Mole was obliged to ring to have fresh candles brought in. M. de Nerval, the Minister, had left at a quarter to two, not without having frequently studied Julien's face in a mirror which hung beside him. His departure had seemed to create an atmo- sphere of relief. While the candles were being changed: 'Heaven knows what that fel- low is going to say to the King!' the man with the waistcoats murmured to his neighbour. 'He can make us look very foolish and spoil our future. 'You must admit that he shows a very rare presumption, indeed ef- frontery, in appearing here. He used to come here before he took office; but a portfolio alters everything, swallows up all a man's private in- terests, he ought to have felt that.' As soon as the Minister was gone, Bonaparte's General had shut his eyes. He now spoke of his health, his wounds, looked at his watch, and left. 'I would bet,' said the man with the waistcoats, 'that the General is running after the Minister; he is going to make his excuses for being found here, and pretend that he is our leader.' When the servants, who were half asleep, had finished changing the candles: 'Let us now begin to deliberate, Gentlemen,' said the chairman, 'and no longer attempt to persuade one another. Let us consider the tenor of the note that in forty-eight hours will be before the eyes of our friends abroad. There has been reference to Ministers. We can say, now that M. de Nerval has left us, what do we care for Ministers? We shall control them.' The Cardinal showed his approval by a delicate smile. 'Nothing easier, it seems to me, than to sum up our position,' said the young Bishop of Agde with the concentrated and restrained fire of the

most exalted fanaticism. Hitherto he had remained silent; his eye, which Julien had watched, at first mild and calm, had grown fiery after the first hour's discussion. Now his heart overflowed like lava from Vesuvius. 'From 1806 to 1814, England made only one mistake,' he said, 'which was her not dealing directly and personally with Napoleon. As soon as that man had created Dukes and Chamberlains, as soon as he had re- stored the Throne, the mission that God had entrusted to him was at an end; he was ripe only for destruction. The Holy Scriptures teach us in more than one passage the way to make an end of tyrants.' (Here fol- lowed several Latin quotations.) 'Today, Gentlemen, it is not a man that we must destroy; it is Paris. The whole of France copies Paris. What is the use of arming your five hundred men in each Department? A hazardous enterprise and one that will never end. What is the use of involving France in a matter which is peculiar to Paris? Paris alone, with her newspapers and her drawing- rooms, has done the harm; let the modern Babylon perish. 'Between the Altar and Paris, there must be a fight to the finish. This catastrophe is indeed to the earthly advantage of the Throne. Why did not Paris dare to breathe under Bonaparte? Ask the artillery of Saint- Roch.' It was not until three o'clock in the morning that Julien left the house with M. de La Mole. The Marquis was depressed and tired. For the first time, in speaking to Julien, he used a tone of supplication. He asked him to promise never to disclose the excesses of zeal, such was his expression, which he had chanced to witness. 'Do not mention it to our friend abroad, unless he deliberately insists on knowing the nature of our young hotheads. What does it matter to them if the State be overthrown? They will be Cardinals, and will take refuge in Rome. We, in our country seats, shall be mas- sacred by the peasants.' The secret note which the Marquis drafted from the long report of six and twenty pages, written by Julien, was not ready until a quarter to five. 'I am dead tired,' said the Marquis, 'and so much can be seen from this note, which is lacking in precision towards the end; I am more dissatis- fied with it than with anything I ever did in my life. Now, my friend,' he went on, 'go and lie down for a few hours, and for fear of your being ab- ducted, I am going to lock you into your room.'

Next day, the Marquis took Julien to a lonely mansion, at some dis- tance from Paris. They found there a curious company who, Julien de- cided, were priests. He was given a passport which bore a false name, but did at last indicate the true goal of his journey, of which he had al- ways feigned ignorance. He started off by himself in a calash. The Marquis had no misgivings as to his memory, Julien had repeated the text of the secret note to him several times; but he was greatly afraid of his being intercepted. 'Remember, whatever you do, to look like a fop who is travelling to kill time,' was his friendly warning, as Julien was leaving the room. 'There may perhaps have been several false brethren in our assembly last night.' The journey was rapid and very tedious. Julien was barely out of the Marquis's sight before he had forgotten both the secret note and his mis- sion, and was thinking of nothing but Mathilde's scorn. In a village, some leagues beyond Metz, the postmaster came to inform him that there were no fresh horses. It was ten o'clock at night; Julien, greatly annoyed, ordered supper. He strolled up and down outside the door and passed unperceived into the stable-yard. He saw no horses there. 'The man had a singular expression all the same,' he said to himself; 'his coarse eye was scrutinising me.' We can see that he was beginning not to believe literally everything that he was told. He thought of making his escape after supper, and in the meanwhile, in order to learn something of the lie of the land, left his room to go and warm himself by the kitchen fire. What was his joy upon finding there Signor Geronimo, the famous singer! Comfortably ensconced in an armchair which he had made them push up close to the fire, the Neapolitan was groaning aloud and talking more, by himself, than the score of German peasants who were gathered round him open-mouthed. 'These people are ruining me,' he cried to Julien, 'I have promised to sing tomorrow at Mayence. Seven Sovereign Princes have assembled there to hear me. But let us take the air,' he added, in a significant tone. When he had gone a hundred yards along the road, and was well out of earshot: 'Do you know what is happening?' he said to Julien; 'this postmaster is a rogue. As I was strolling about, I gave a franc to a little ragamuffin who told me everything. There are more than a dozen horses in a stable at the other end of the village. They mean to delay some courier.'

'Indeed?' said Julien, with an innocent air. It was not enough to have discovered the fraud, they must get on: this was what Geronimo and his friend could not manage to do. 'We must wait for the daylight,' the singer said finally, 'they are suspicious of us. Tomorrow morning we shall order a good breakfast; while they are pre- paring it we go out for a stroll, we escape, hire fresh horses, and reach the next post.' 'And your luggage?' said Julien, who thought that perhaps Geronimo himself might have been sent to intercept him. It was time to sup and re- tire to bed. Julien was still in his first sleep, when he was awakened with a start by the sound of two people talking in his room, apparently quite unconcerned. He recognised the postmaster, armed with a dark lantern. Its light was concentrated upon the carriage-trunk, which Julien had had carried up to his room. With the postmaster was another man who was calmly go- ing through the open trunk. Julien could make out only the sleeves of his coat, which were black and close-fitting. 'It is a cassock,' he said to himself, and quietly seized the pocket pistols which he had placed under his pillow. 'You need not be afraid of his waking, Monsieur le Cure,' said the postmaster. 'The wine we gave them was some of what you prepared yourself.' 'I can find no trace of papers,' replied the cure. 'Plenty of linen, oils, po- mades and fripperies; he is a young man of the world, occupied with his own pleasures. The envoy will surely be the other, who pretends to speak with an Italian accent.' The men came up to Julien to search the pockets of his travelling coat. He was strongly tempted to kill them as robbers. This could involve no dangerous consequences. He longed to do it... 'I should be a mere fool,' he said to himself, 'I should be endangering my mission.' After searching his coat, 'this is no diplomat,' said the priest: he moved away, and wisely. 'If he touches me in my bed, it will be the worse for him!' Julien was saying to himself; 'he may quite well come and stab me, and that I will not allow.' The cure turned his head, Julien half-opened his eyes; what was his as- tonishment! It was the abbe Castanede! And indeed, although the two men had tried to lower their voices, he had felt, from the first, that he re- cognised the sound of one of them. He was seized with a passionate de- sire to rid the world of one of its vilest scoundrels ... 'But my mission!' he reminded himself.

The priest and his acolyte left the room. A quarter of an hour later, Julien pretended to awake. He called for help and roused the whole house. 'I have been poisoned,' he cried, 'I am in horrible agony!' He wanted a pretext for going to Geronimo's rescue. He found him half asphyxiated by the laudanum that had been in his wine. Julien, fearing some pleasantry of this kind, had supped upon chocol- ate which he had brought with him from Paris. He could not succeed in arousing Geronimo sufficiently to make him agree to leave the place. 'Though you offered me the whole Kingdom of Naples,' said the sing- er, 'I would not forgo the pleasure of sleep at this moment.' 'But the seven Sovereign Princes!' 'They can wait.' Julien set off alone and arrived without further incident at the abode of the eminent personage. He spent a whole morning in vainly soliciting an audience. Fortunately, about four o'clock, the Duke decided to take the air. Julien saw him leave the house on foot, and had no hesitation in go- ing up to him and begging for alms. When within a few feet of the emin- ent personage, he drew out the Marquis de La Mole's watch, and flour- ished it ostentatiously. 'Follow me at distance,' said the other, without looking at him. After walking for a quarter of a league, the Duke turned abruptly in to a little Kaffeehaus. It was in a bedroom of this humblest form of inn that Julien had the honour of reciting his four pages to the Duke. When he had finished: 'Begin again, and go more slowly,' he was told. The Prince took down notes. 'Go on foot to the next post. Leave your luggage and your calash here. Make your way to Strasbourg as best you can, and on the twenty-second of the month'—it was now the tenth—'be in this coffee-house here at half-past twelve. Do not leave here for half an hour. Silence!' Such were the only words that Julien heard said. They sufficed to fill him with the deepest admiration. 'It is thus,' he thought, 'that one handles affairs; what would this great statesman say if he had heard those hotheaded chatterboxes three days ago?' Julien took two days to reach Strasbourg, he felt that there was noth- ing for him to do there. He made a wide circuit. 'If that devil, the abbe Castanede has recognised me, he is not the man to be easily shaken off ... And what a joy to him to make a fool of me, and to spoil my mission!'

The abbe Castanede, Chief of Police to the Congregation along the whole of the Northern frontier, had mercifully not recognised him. And the Jesuits of Strasbourg, albeit most zealous, never thought of keeping an eye on Julien, who, with his Cross and his blue greatcoat, had the air of a young soldier greatly concerned with his personal appearance.

Chapter Strasbourg Fascination! Thou sharest with love all its energy, all its capacity for suffering. Its enchanting pleasures, its sweet delights are alone beyond thy sphere. I could not say, as I saw her asleep: She is all mine with her angelic beauty and her sweet frailties! Behold her delivered into my power, as heaven made her in its compassion to enchant a man's heart. Ode by SCHILLER Obliged to spend a week in Strasbourg, Julien sought to distract him- self with thoughts of martial glory and of devotion to his country. Was he in love, then? He could not say, only he found in his bruised heart Mathilde the absolute mistress of his happiness as of his imagination. He required all his natural energy to keep himself from sinking into despair. To think of anything that bore no relation to Mademoiselle de La Mole was beyond his power. Ambition, the mere triumphs of vanity, had I dis- tracted him in the past from the sentiments that Madame de Renal in- spired in him. Mathilde had absorbed all; he found her everywhere in his future. On every hand, in this future, Julien foresaw failure. This creature whom we saw at Verrieres so filled with presumption, so arrogant, had fallen into an absurd extreme of modesty. Three days earlier he would have killed the abbe Castanede with pleasure, and at Strasbourg, had a boy picked a quarrel with him, he would have offered the boy an apology. In thinking over the adversaries, the enemies whom he had encountered in the course of his life, he found that invariably he, Julien, had been in the wrong. The fact was that he had now an implacable enemy in that powerful imagination, which before had been constantly employed in painting such brilliant successes for him in the future. The absolute solitude of a traveller's existence strengthened the power of this dark imagination. What a treasure would a friend have been!

'But,' Julien asked himself, 'is there a heart in the world that beats for me? And if I had a friend, does not honour impose on me an eternal silence?' He took a horse and rode sadly about the neighbourhood of Kehl; it is a village on the bank of the Rhine, immortalised by Desaix and Gouvion Saint-Cyr. A German peasant pointed out to him the little streams, the roads, the islands in the Rhine which the valour of those great Generals has made famous. Julien, holding the reins in his left hand, was carrying spread out in his right the superb map which illustrates the Memoirs of Marshal Saint-Cyr. A joyful exclamation made him raise his head. It was Prince Korasoff, his London friend, who had expounded to him some months earlier the first principles of high fatuity. Faithful to this great art, Korasoff, who had arrived in Strasbourg the day before, had been an hour at Kehl, and had never in his life read a line about the siege of 1796, began to explain it all to Julien. The German peasant gazed at him in astonishment; for he knew enough French to make out the enorm- ous blunders into which the Prince fell. Julien's thoughts were a thou- sand leagues away from the peasant's, he was looking with amazement at this handsome young man, and admiring his grace in the saddle. 'A happy nature!' he said to himself. 'How well his breeches fit him, how elegantly his hair is cut! Alas, if I had been like that, perhaps after loving me for three days she would not have taken a dislike to me.' When the Prince had come to an end of his version of the siege of Kehl: 'You look like a Trappist,' he said to Julien, 'you are infringing the principle of gravity I taught you in London. A melancholy air can never be the right thing; what you want is a bored air. If you are melancholy, it must be because you want something, there is something in which you have not succeeded. 'It is shewing your inferiority. If you are bored, on the other hand, it is the person who has tried in vain to please you who is inferior. Realise, my dear fellow, what a grave mistake you are making.' Julien flung a crown to the peasant who stood listening to them, open- mouthed. 'Good,' said the Prince, 'that is graceful, a noble disdain! Very good!' And he put his horse into a gallop. Julien followed him, filled with a stu- pefied admiration. 'Ah! If I had been like that, she would not have preferred Croisenois to me!' The more his reason was shocked by the absurdities of the Prince, the more he despised himself for not admiring them, and deemed him- self unfortunate in not sharing them. Self-contempt can be carried no farther.

The Prince found him decidedly melancholy: 'Ah, my dear fellow,' he said to him, as they rode into Strasbourg, 'have you lost all your money, or can you be in love with some little actress?' The Russians imitate French ways, but always at a distance of fifty years. They have now reached the days of Louis XV. These jests, at the expense of love, filled Julien's eyes with tears: 'Why should not I consult so friendly a man?' he asked himself suddenly. 'Well, yes, my friend,' he said to the Prince, 'you find me in Strasbourg, madly in love, indeed crossed in love. A charming woman, who lives in a neighbouring town, has abandoned me after three days of passion, and the change is killing me.' He described to the Prince, under an assumed name, the actions and character of Mathilde. 'Do not go on,' said Korasoff: 'to give you confidence in your physi- cian, I am going to cut short your confidences. This young woman's hus- band possesses an enormous fortune, or, what is more likely, she herself belongs to the highest nobility of the place. She must be proud of something.' Julien nodded his head, he had no longer the heart to speak. 'Very good,' said the Prince, 'here are three medicines, all rather bitter, which you are going to take without delay: 'First: You must every day see Madame —— what do you call her?' 'Madame de Dubois.' 'What a name!' said the Prince, with a shout of laughter; 'but forgive me, to you it is sublime. It is essential that you see Madame de Dubois every day; above all do not appear to her cold and cross; remember the great principle of your age: be the opposite to what people expect of you. Show yourself precisely as you were a week before you were honoured with her favours.' 'Ah! I was calm then,' cried Julien, in desperation, 'I thought that I pit- ied her ... ' 'The moth singes its wings in the flame of the candle,' the Prince con- tinued, 'a metaphor as old as the world. 'First of all: you will see her every day. 'Secondly: you will pay court to a woman of her acquaintance, but without any appearance of passion, you understand? I do not conceal from you, yours is a difficult part to play: you have to act, and if she dis- covers that you are acting, you are doomed.' 'She is so clever, and I am not! I am doomed,' said Julien sadly.

'No, you are only more in love than I thought. Madame de Dubois is profoundly taken up with herself, like all women who have received from heaven either too high a rank or too much money. She looks at her- self instead of looking at you, and so does not know you. During the two or three amorous impulses to which she has yielded in your favour, by a great effort of imagination, she beheld in you the hero of her dreams and not yourself as you really are ... 'But what the devil, these are the elements, my dear Sorel, are you still a schoolboy? ... 'Egad! Come into this shop; look at that charming black cravat; you would say it was made by John Anderson, of Burlington Street; do me the pleasure of buying it, and of throwing right away that dreadful black rope which you have round your neck. 'And now,' the Prince went on as they left the shop of the first hosier in Strasbourg, 'who are the friends of Madame de Dubois? Good God, what a name! Do not be angry, my dear Sorel, I cannot help it... To whom will you pay court?' 'To a prude of prudes, the daughter of an enormously rich stocking- merchant. She has the loveliest eyes in the world, which please me vastly; she certainly occupies the first place in the district; but amid all her grandeur she blushes and loses her head entirely if anyone refers to trade and a shop. And unfortunately for her, her father was one of the best-known tradesmen in Strasbourg.' 'So that if one mentions industry,' said the Prince, with a laugh, 'you may be sure that your fair one is thinking of herself and not of you. The weakness is divine and most useful, it will prevent you from ever doing anything foolish in her fair eyes. Your success is assured.' Julien was thinking of Madame la Marechale de Fervaques, who often came to the Hotel de La Mole. She was a beautiful foreigner who had married the Marshal a year before his death. Her whole life seemed to have no other object than to make people forget that she was the daugh- ter of an industrial, and in order to count for something in Paris she had set herself at the head of the forces of virtue. Julien admired the Prince sincerely; what would he not have given to have his absurd affectations! The conversation between the friends was endless; Korasoff was in raptures: never had a Frenchman given him so long a hearing. 'And so I have succeeded at last,' the Prince said to him- self with delight, 'in making my voice heard when I give lessons to my masters!

'It is quite understood,' he repeated to Julien for the tenth time, 'not a vestige of passion when you are talking to the young beauty, the Strasbourg stocking-merchant's daughter, in the presence of Madame de Dubois. On the contrary, burning passion when you write. Reading a well-written love letter is a prude's supreme pleasure; it is a momentary relaxation. She is not acting a part, she dares to listen to her heart; and so, two letters daily.' 'Never, never!' said Julien, losing courage; 'I would let myself be brayed in a mortar sooner than compose three sentences; I am a corpse, my dear fellow, expect nothing more of me. Leave me to die by the roadside.' 'And who said anything about composing phrases? I have in my hold- all six volumes of love letters in manuscript. There are specimens for every kind of woman, I have a set for the most rigid virtue. Didn't Kalisky make love on Richmond Terrace, you know, a few miles out of London, to the prettiest Quakeress in the whole of England?' Julien was less wretched when he parted from his friend at two o'clock in the morning. Next day the Prince sent for a copyist, and two days later Julien had fifty-three love letters carefully numbered, intended to cope with the most sublime and melancholy virtue. 'There would be fifty-four,' said the Prince, 'only Kalisky was shown the door; but what does it matter to you, being ill-treated by the stocking-merchant's daughter, since you are seeking to influence only the heart of Madame de Dubois?' Every day they went out riding: the Prince was madly taken with Juli- en. Not knowing what token to give him of his sudden affection, he ended by offering him the hand of one of his cousins, a wealthy heiress in Moscow; 'and once you are married,' he explained, 'my influence and the Cross you are wearing will make you a Colonel in two years.' 'But this Cross was not given me by Napoleon, quite the reverse.' 'What does that matter,' said the Prince, 'didn't he invent it? It is still the first decoration by far in Europe.' Julien was on the point of accepting; but duty recalled him to the em- inent personage; on parting from Korasoff, he promised to write. He re- ceived the reply to the secret note that he had brought, and hastened to Paris; but he had barely been by himself for two days on end, before the thought of leaving France and Mathilde seemed to him a punishment worse than death itself. 'I shall not wed the millions that Korasoff offers me,' he told himself, 'but I shall follow his advice.

'After all, the art of seduction is his business; he has thought of nothing else for more than fifteen years, for he is now thirty. One cannot say that he is lacking in intelligence; he is shrewd and cautious; enthusiasm, po- etry are impossible in such a nature: he is calculating; all the more reason why he should not be mistaken. 'There is no help for it, I am going to pay court to Madame de Fervaques. 'She will bore me a little, perhaps, but I shall gaze into those lovely eyes which are so like the eyes that loved me best in the world. 'She is foreign; that is a fresh character to be studied. 'I am mad, I am going under, I must follow the advice of a friend, and pay no heed to myself.'

Chapter The Office of Virtue But if I take this pleasure with so much prudence and circum- spection, it ceases to be a pleasure for me. LOPE DE VEGA Immediately on his return to Paris, and on leaving the study of the Marquis de La Mole, who appeared greatly disconcerted by the mes- sages that were conveyed to him, our hero hastened to find Conte Altamira. With the distinction of being under sentence of death, this handsome foreigner combined abundant gravity and had the good for- tune to be devout; these two merits and, more than all, the exalted birth of the Count were entirely to the taste of Madame de Fervaques, who saw much of him. Julien confessed to him gravely that he was deeply in love with her. 'She represents the purest and loftiest virtue,' replied Altamira, 'only it is a trifle Jesuitical and emphatic. There are days on which I understand every word that she uses, but I do not understand the sentence as a whole. She often makes me think that I do not know French as well as people say. This acquaintance will make you talked about; it will give you a position in society. But let us go and see Bustos,' said Conte Altamira, who had an orderly mind; 'he has made love to Madame la Marechale.' Don Diego Bustos made them explain the matter to him in detail, without saying a word, like a barrister in chambers. He had a plump, monkish face, with black moustaches, and an unparalleled gravity; in other respects, a good carbonaro. 'I understand,' he said at length to Julien. 'Has the Marechale de Fer- vaques had lovers, or has she not? Have you, therefore, any hope of suc- cess? That is the question. It is as much as to say that, for my own part, I have failed. Now that I am no longer aggrieved, I put it to myself in this way: often she is out of temper, and, as I shall shortly prove to you, she is nothing if not vindictive.

'I do not find in her that choleric temperament which is a mark of geni- us and covers every action with a sort of glaze of passion. It is, on the contrary, to her calm and phlegmatic Dutch manner that she owes her rare beauty and the freshness of her complexion.' Julien was growing impatient with the deliberateness and imperturb- able phlegm of the Spaniard; now and again, in spite of himself, he gave vent to a monosyllabic comment. 'Will you listen to me?' Don Diego Bustos inquired gravely. 'Pardon the furia francese; I am all ears,' said Julien. 'Well, then, the Marechale de Fervaques is much given to hatred; she is pitiless in her pursuit of people she has never seen, lawyers, poor devils of literary men who have written songs like Colle, you know? "J'ai la marotte D'aimer Marote," etc.' And Julien was obliged to listen to the quotation to the end. The Span- iard greatly enjoyed singing in French. That divine song was never listened to with greater impatience. When he had finished: 'The Marechale,' said Don Diego Bustos, 'has ruined the author of the song: "Un jour l'amant au cabaret ... "' Julien was in an agony lest he should wish to sing it. He contented himself with analysing it. It was, as a matter of fact, impious and hardly decent. 'When the Marechale flew into a passion with that song,' said Don Diego, 'I pointed out to her that a woman of her rank ought not to read all the stupid things that are published. Whatever progress piety and gravity may make, there will always be in France a literature of the tav- ern. When Madame de Fervaques had the author, a poor devil on half pay, deprived of a post worth eighteen hundred francs: "Take care," said I to her, "you have attacked this rhymester with your weapons, he may reply to you with his rhymes: he will make a song about virtue. The gil- ded saloons will be on your side; the people who like to laugh will repeat his epigrams." Do you know, Sir, what answer the Marechale made me? "In the Lord's service all Paris would see me tread the path of martyr- dom; it would be a novel spectacle in France. The people would learn to respect the quality. It would be the happiest day of my life." Never were her eyes more brilliant.' 'And she has superb eyes,' exclaimed Julien. 'I see that you are in love ... Very well, then,' Don Diego Bustos went on gravely, 'she has not the choleric constitution that impels one to ven- geance. If she enjoys injuring people, nevertheless, it is because she is

unhappy, I suspect inward suffering. May she not be a prude who has grown weary of her calling?' The Spaniard gazed at him in silence for fully a minute. 'That is the whole question,' he went on gravely, 'and it is from this that you may derive some hope. I gave it much thought during the two years in which I professed myself her most humble servant. Your whole future, you, Sir, who are in love, hangs on this great problem. Is she a prude, weary of her calling, and malicious because she is miserable?' 'Or rather,' said Altamira, emerging at last from his profound silence, 'can it be what I have said to you twenty times? Simply and solely French vanity; it is the memory of her father, the famous cloth merchant, that causes the unhappiness of a character naturally morose and dry. There could be only one happiness for her, that of living in Toledo, and being tormented by a confessor, who every day would show her hell gaping for her.' As Julien rose to leave: 'Altamira tells me that you are one of us,' Don Diego said to him, graver than ever. 'One day you will help us to recon- quer our freedom, and so I wish to help you in this little diversion. It is as well that you should be acquainted with the Marechale's style; here are four letters in her hand.' 'I shall have them copied,' cried Julien, 'and return them to you.' 'And no one shall ever learn from you a single word of what we have been saying?' 'Never, upon my honour!' cried Julien. 'Then may heaven help you!' the Spaniard concluded; and he accom- panied Julien and Altamira in silence to the head of the stair. This scene cheered our hero somewhat; he almost smiled. 'And here is the devout Altamira,' he said to himself, 'helping me in an adulterous enterprise.' Throughout the whole of the grave conversation of Don Diego Bustos, Julien had been attentive to the stroke of the hours on the clock of the Hotel d'Aligre. The dinner hour was approaching, he was to see Mathilde again! He went home, and dressed himself with great care. 'My first blunder,' he said to himself, as he was going downstairs; 'I must carry out the Prince's orders to the letter.' He returned to his room, and put on a travelling costume of the ut- most simplicity. 'Now,' he thought, 'I must consider how I am to look at her.' It was only half-past five, and dinner was at six. He decided to go down to the

drawing-room, which he found deserted. The sight of the blue sofa moved him to tears; soon his cheeks began to burn. 'I must get rid of this absurd sensibility,' he said to himself angrily; 'it will betray me.' He took up a newspaper to keep himself in countenance, and strolled three or four times from the drawing-room to the garden. It was only in fear and trembling and safely concealed behind a big oak tree that he ventured to raise his eyes to the window of Mademois- elle de La Mole's room. It was fast shut; he nearly fell to the ground, and stood for a long time leaning against the oak; then, with a tottering step, he went to look at the gardener's ladder. The link of the chain, forced open by him in circumstances, alas, so dif- ferent, had not been mended. Carried away by a mad impulse, Julien pressed it to his lips. After a long course of wandering between drawing-room and garden, he found himself horribly tired; this was an initial success which pleased him greatly. 'My eyes will be dull and will not betray me!' Gradually, the guests arrived in the drawing-room; the door never opened without plunging Julien in mortal dread. They sat down to table. At length Mademoiselle de La Mole appeared, still faithful to her principle of keeping the others waiting. She blushed a deep red on seeing Julien; she had not been told of his arrival. Following Prince Korasoff's advice, Julien looked at her hands; they were trem- bling. Disquieted himself, beyond all expression, by this discovery, he was thankful to appear to be merely tired. M. de La Mole sang his praises. The Marquise addressed him shortly afterwards, and expressed concern at his appearance of fatigue. Julien kept on saying to himself: 'I must not look at Mademoiselle de La Mole too much, but I ought not either to avoid her eye. I must appear to be what I really was a week before my disaster ... ' He had occasion to be satisfied with his success, and remained in the drawing-room. Attentive for the first time to the lady of the house, he spared no effort to make the men of her circle talk, and to keep the conversation alive. His politeness was rewarded: about eight o'clock, Madame la Mare- chale de Fervaques was announced. Julien left the room and presently reappeared, dressed with the most scrupulous care. Madame de La Mole was vastly flattered by this mark of respect, and sought to give him a proof of her satisfaction by speaking of his travels to Madame de Fer- vaques. Julien took his seat beside the Marechale, in such a way that his eyes should not be visible to Mathilde. Thus placed, and following all the rules of the art, he made Madame de Fervaques the object of the most

awed admiration. It was with an outburst on this sentiment that the first of the fifty-three letters of which Prince Korasoff had made him a present began. The Marechale announced that she was going on to the Opera-Bouffe. Julien hastened there; he found the Chevalier de Beauvoisis, who took him to the box of the Gentlemen of the Household, immediately beside that of Madame de Fervaques. Julien gazed at her incessantly. 'I must,' he said to himself, as he returned home, 'keep a diary of the siege; otherwise I should lose count of my attacks.' He forced himself to write down two or three pages on this boring subject, and thus succeeded (marvel of mar- vels!) in hardly giving a thought to Mademoiselle de La Mole. Mathilde had almost forgotten him during his absence. 'After all, he is only a common person,' she thought, 'his name will always remind me of the greatest mistake of my life. I must return in all sincerity to the recog- nised standards of prudence and honour; a woman has everything to lose in forgetting them.' She showed herself ready to permit at length the conclusion of the arrangement with the Marquis de Croisenois, begun so long since. He was wild with joy; he would have been greatly astonished had anyone told him that it was resignation that lay at the root of this at- titude on Mathilde's part, which was making him so proud. All Mademoiselle de La Mole's ideas changed at the sight of Julien. 'In reality, that is my husband,' she said to herself; 'if I return in sincerity to the standards of prudence, it is obviously he that I ought to marry.' She was prepared for importunities, for an air of misery on Julien's part; she prepared her answers: for doubtless, on rising from table, he would endeavour to say a few words to her. Far from it, he remained fixed in the drawing-room, his eyes never even turned towards the garden, heaven knows with how great an effort! 'It would be better to get our explanation over at once,' Mademoiselle de La Mole told herself; she went out by herself to the garden, Julien did not appear there. Mathilde returned and strolled past the drawing-room windows; she saw him busily engaged in describing to Madame de Fervaques the old ruined castles that crown the steep banks of the Rhine and give them so distinct- ive a character. He was beginning to acquit himself none too badly in the use of the sentimental and picturesque language which is called wit in certain drawing-rooms. Prince Korasoff would indeed have been proud, had he been in Paris: the evening was passing exactly as he had foretold. He would have approved of the mode of behaviour to which Julien adhered throughout the days that followed.

An intrigue among those constituting the Power behind the Throne was about to dispose of several Blue Ribands; Madame la Marechale de Fervaques insisted that her great-uncle should be made a Knight of the Order. The Marquis de La Mole was making a similar claim for his father-in-law; they combined their efforts, and the Marechale came al- most every day to the Hotel de La Mole. It was from her that Julien learned that the Marquis was to become a Minister: he offered the Camarilla a highly ingenious plan for destroying the Charter, without any fuss, in three years' time. Julien might expect a Bishopric, if M. de La Mole entered the Ministry; but to his eyes all these important interests were as though hidden by a veil. His imagination perceived them now only vaguely, and so to speak in the distance. The fearful misery which was driving him mad made him see every interest in life in the state of his relations with Mademois- elle de La Mole. He calculated that after five or six years of patient effort, he might succeed in making her love him once again. This coolest of heads had, as we see, sunk to a state of absolute unreas- on. Of all the qualities that had distinguished him in the past, there re- mained to him only a trace of firmness. Faithful to the letter to the plan of conduct dictated to him by Prince Korasoff, every evening he took his place as near as possible to the armchair occupied by Madame de Fer- vaques, but found it impossible to think of a word to say to her. The effort that he was imposing on himself to appear cured in the eyes of Mathilde absorbed all his spiritual strength, he remained rooted be- side the Marechale like a barely animate being; his eyes even, as in the extremity of physical suffering, had lost all their fire. Since Madame de La Mole's attitude towards the world was never anything more than a feeble copy of the opinions of that husband who might make her a Duchess, for some days she had been lauding Julien's merits to the skies.

Chapter Moral Love There also was of course in Adeline That calm patrician polish in the address, Which ne'er can pass the equinoctial line Of anything which nature would express; Just as a mandarin finds nothing fine, At least his manner suffers not to guess That anything he views can greatly please. Don Juan, XIII. 34 'There is a trace of madness in the way the whole of this family have of looking at things,' thought the Marechale; 'they are infatuated with their little abbe, who can do nothing but sit and stare at one; it is true, his eyes are not bad-looking.' Julien, for his part, found in the Marechale's manner an almost perfect example of that patrician calm which betokens a scrupulous politeness and still more the impossibility of any keen emotion. Any sudden out- burst, a want of self-control, would have shocked Madame de Fervaques almost as much as a want of dignity towards one's inferiors. The least sign of sensibility would have been in her eyes like a sort of moral intox- ication for which one ought to blush, and which was highly damaging to what a person of exalted rank owed to herself. Her great happiness was to speak of the King's latest hunt, her favourite book the Memoires du duc de Saint-Simon, especially the genealogical part. Julien knew the place in the drawing-room which, as the lights were arranged, suited the style of beauty of Madame de Fervaques. He would be there waiting for her, but took great care to turn his chair so that he should not be able to see Mathilde. Astonished by this persistence in hid- ing from her, one evening she left the blue sofa and came to work at a little table that stood by the Marquise's armchair. Julien could see her at quite a close range from beneath the brim of Madame de Fervaques's hat. Those eyes, which governed his destiny, frightened him at first, seen at such close range, then jerked him violently out of his habitual apathy; he talked, and talked very well.

He addressed himself to the Marechale, but his sole object was to in- fluence the heart of Mathilde. He grew so animated that finally Madame de Fervaques could not understand what he said. This was so much to the good. Had it occurred to Julien to follow it up with a few expressions of German mysticism, religious fervour and Je- suitry, the Marechale would have numbered him straightway among the superior persons called to regenerate the age. 'Since he shows such bad taste,' Mademoiselle de La Mole said to her- self, 'as to talk for so long and with such fervour to Madame de Fer- vaques, I shall not listen to him any more.' For the rest of the evening she kept her word, albeit with difficulty. At midnight, when she took up her mother's candlestick, to escort her to her room, Madame de La Mole stopped on the stairs to utter a perfect panegyric of Julien. This completed Mathilde's ill humour; she could not send herself to sleep. A thought came to her which soothed her: 'The things that I despise may even be great distinctions in the Marechale's eyes.' As for Julien, he had now taken action, he was less wretched; his eyes happened to fall on the Russia-leather portfolio in which Prince Korasoff had placed the fifty-three love letters of which he had made him a present. Julien saw a note at the foot of the first letter: 'Send No. 1 a week after the first meeting.' 'I am late!' exclaimed Julien, 'for it is ever so long now since I first met Madame de Fervaques.' He set to work at once to copy out this first love letter; it was a homily stuffed with phrases about virtue, and of a deadly dullness; Julien was fortunate in falling asleep over the second page. Some hours later the risen sun surprised him crouching with his head on the table. One of the most painful moments of his life was that in which, every morning, as he awoke, he discovered his distress. This morning, he finished copying his letter almost with a laugh. 'Is it pos- sible,' he asked himself, 'that there can ever have been a young man who could write such stuff?' He counted several sentences of nine lines. At the foot of the original he caught sight of a pencilled note. 'One delivers these letters oneself: on horseback, a black cravat, a blue greatcoat. One hands the letter to the porter with a contrite air; profound melancholy in the gaze. If one should see a lady's maid, wipe the eyes furtively. Address a few words to the maid.' All these instructions were faithfully carried out. 'What I am doing is very bold,' thought Julien, as he rode away from the Hotel de Fervaques, 'but so much the worse for Korasoff. To dare

write to so notorious a prude! I am going to be treated with the utmost contempt, and nothing will amuse me more. This is, really, the only form of comedy to which I can respond. Yes, to cover with ridicule that odious being whom I call myself will amuse me. If I obeyed my instincts I should commit some crime for the sake of distraction.' For a month past, the happiest moment in Julien's day had been that in which he brought his horse back to the stables. Korasoff had expressly forbidden him to look, upon any pretext whatsoever, at the mistress who had abandoned him. But the paces of that horse which she knew so well, the way in which Julien rapped with his whip at the stable door to sum- mon a groom, sometimes drew Mathilde to stand behind her window curtain. The muslin was so fine that Julien could see through it. By look- ing up in a certain way from under the brim of his hat, he caught a glimpse of Mathilde's form without seeing her eyes. 'Consequently,' he told himself, 'she cannot see mine, and this is not the same as looking at her.' That evening, Madame de Fervaques behaved to him exactly as though she had not received the philosophical, mystical and religious dissertation which, in the morning, he had handed to her porter with such an air of melancholy. The evening before, chance had revealed to Julien the secret springs of eloquence; he arranged himself so as to be able to see Mathilde's eyes. She, meanwhile, immediately after the arrival of the Marechale, rose from the blue sofa: this was a desertion of her reg- ular company. M. de Croisenois showed consternation at this new caprice; his evident distress relieved Julien of the keenest pangs of his own sufferings. This unexpected turn in his affairs made him talk like an angel; and as self-esteem finds its way even into hearts that serve as temples to the most august virtue: 'Madame de La Mole is right,' the Marechale said to herself, as she stepped into her carriage, 'that young priest has distinc- tion. My presence must, at first, have frightened him. Indeed, everything that one finds in that house is very frivolous; all the virtue I see there is the result of age, and stood in great need of the congealing hand of time. That young man must have seen the difference; he writes well; but I am much afraid that the request that I should enlighten him with my advice, which he makes in his letter, is in reality only a sentiment unaware of itself. 'And yet, how many conversions have begun in this way! What leads me to augur well of this one is the difference in his style from that of the young men whose letters I have had occasion to see. It is impossible not

to recognise unction, a profound earnestness and great conviction in the prose of this young Levite; he must have the soothing virtue of Massillon.'

Chapter The Best Positions in the Church Service! talent! merit! bah! belong to a coterie. TELEMACHUS Thus the idea of a Bishopric was for the first time blended with that of Julien in the head of a woman who sooner or later would be distributing the best positions in the Church of France. This prospect would have made little difference to him; for the moment, his thoughts rose to noth- ing that was alien to his present misery: everything intensified it; for in- stance the sight of his bedroom had become intolerable to him. At night, when he came upstairs with his candle, each piece of furniture, every little ornament seemed to acquire the power of speech to inform him harshly of some fresh detail of his misery. This evening, 'I am a galley slave,' he said to himself, as he entered it, with a vivacity long unfamiliar to him: 'let us hope that the second letter will be as boring as the first.' It was even more so. What he was copying seemed to him so absurd that he began to transcribe it line for line, without a thought of the meaning. 'It is even more emphatic,' he said to himself, 'than the official docu- ments of the Treaty of Muenster, which my tutor in diplomacy made me copy out in London.' It was only then that he remembered the letters from Madame de Fer- vaques, the originals of which he had forgotten to restore to the grave Spaniard, Don Diego Bustos. He searched for them; they were really al- most as fantastic a rigmarole as those of the young Russian gentleman. They were completely vague. They expressed everything and nothing. 'It is the Aeolian harp of style,' thought Julien. 'Amid the most lofty thoughts about annihilation, death, the infinite, etc., I can see no reality save a shocking fear of ridicule.' The monologue which we have here abridged was repeated nightly for a fortnight. Falling asleep while transcribing a sort of commentary on the

Apocalypse, going next day to deliver a letter with a melancholy air, leaving his horse in the stable yard with the hope of catching a glimpse of Mathilde's gown, working, putting in an appearance in the evening at the Opera when Madame de Fervaques did not come to the Hotel de La Mole; such were the monotonous events of Julien's existence. They be- came more interesting when Madame de Fervaques paid a visit to the Marquise; then he could steal a glance at Mathilde's eyes beneath the side of the Marechale's hat, and would wax eloquent. His picturesque and sentimental phrases began to assume a turn at once more striking and more elegant. He was fully aware that what he was saying seemed absurd to Math- ilde, but he sought to impress her by the elegance of his diction. 'The falser the things I say, the more I ought to appeal to her,' thought Julien; and then, with a shocking boldness, he began to exaggerate certain as- pects of nature. He very soon perceived that, if he were not to appear vulgar in the eyes of the Marechale, he must above all avoid any simple or reasonable idea. He continued on these lines, or abridged his amplific- ations according as he read success or indifference in the eyes of the two great ladies to whom he must appeal. On the whole, his life was less horrible than at the time when his days passed in inaction. 'But,' he said to himself one evening, 'here I am transcribing the fif- teenth of these abominable dissertations; the first fourteen have been faithfully delivered to the Marechale's Swiss. I shall soon have the hon- our of filling all the pigeonholes in her desk. And yet she treats me ex- actly as though I were not writing! What can be the end of all this? Can my constancy bore her as much as it bores me? I am bound to say that this Russian, Korasoff's friend, who was in love with the fair Quakeress of Richmond, must have been a terrible fellow in his day; no one could be more deadly.' Like everyone of inferior intelligence whom chance brings into touch with the operations of a great general, Julien understood nothing of the attack launched by the young Russian upon the heart of the fair English maid. The first forty letters were intended only to make her pardon his boldness in writing. It was necessary to make this gentle person, who perhaps was vastly bored, form the habit of receiving letters that were perhaps a trifle less insipid than her everyday life. One morning, a letter was handed to Julien; he recognised the armorial bearings of Madame de Fervaques, and broke the seal with an eagerness

which would have seemed quite impossible to him a few days earlier: it was only an invitation to dine. He hastened to consult Prince Korasoff's instructions. Unfortunately, the young Russian had chosen to be as frivolous as Dorat, just where he ought to have been simple and intelligible; Julien could not discover the moral attitude which he was supposed to adopt at the Marechale's table. Her drawing-room was the last word in magnificence, gilded like the Galerie de Diane in the Tuileries, with oil paintings in the panels. There were blank spaces in these paintings, Julien learned later on that the sub- jects had seemed hardly decent to the lady of the house, who had had the pictures corrected. 'A moral age!' he thought. In this drawing-room he remarked three of the gentlemen who had been present at the drafting of the secret note. One of them, the Right Reverend Bishop of ——, the Marechale's uncle, had the patronage of be- nefices, and, it was said, could refuse nothing to his niece. 'What a vast stride I have made,' thought Julien, with a melancholy smile, 'and how cold it leaves me! Here I am dining with the famous Bishop of ——.' The dinner was indifferent and the conversation irritating. 'It is like the table of contents of a dull book,' thought Julien. 'All the greatest subjects of human thought are proudly displayed in it. Listen to it for three minutes, and you ask yourself which is more striking, the emphasis of the speaker or his shocking ignorance.' The reader has doubtless forgotten that little man of letters, named Tanbeau, the nephew of the Academician and an embryo professor, who, with his vile calumnies, seemed to be employed in poisoning the drawing-room of the Hotel de La Mole. It was from this little man that Julien first gleaned the idea that it might well be that Madame de Fervaques, while refraining from answer- ing his letters, looked with indulgence upon the sentiment that dictated them. The black heart of M. Tanbeau was torn asunder by the thought of Julien's successes; but inasmuch as, looking at it from another angle, a deserving man cannot, any more than a fool, be in two places at once, 'if Sorel becomes the lover of the sublime Marechale,' the future professor told himself, 'she will place him in the Church in some advantageous manner, and I shall be rid of him at the Hotel de La Mole.' M. l'abbe Pirard also addressed long sermons to Julien on his successes at the Hotel de Fervaques. There was a sectarian jealousy between the austere Jansenist and the Jesuitical, regenerative and monarchical drawing-room of the virtuous Marechale.

Chapter Manon Lescaut Now once he was fully convinced of the foolishness and idiocy of the prior, he succeeded quite straightforwardly by calling black white, and white black. LICHTENBERG The Russian instructions laid down categorically that one must never contradict in speech the person with whom one corresponded. One must never depart, upon any account, from an attitude of the most ecstatic ad- miration; the letters were all based upon this supposition. One evening, at the Opera, in Madame de Fervaques's box, Julien praised to the skies the ballet in Manon Lescaut. 16 His sole reason for do- ing so was that he found it insipid. The Marechale said that this ballet was greatly inferior to abbe Prevost's novel. 'What!' thought Julien, with surprise and amusement, 'a person of such extreme virtue praise a novel!' Madame de Fervaques used to profess, two or three times weekly, the most utter scorn for the writers, who, by means of those vulgar works, sought to corrupt a younger generation only too prone to the errors of the senses. 'In that immoral and pernicious class, Manon Lescaut,' the Marechale went on, 'occupies, they say, one of the first places. The frailties and well- merited sufferings of a thoroughly criminal heart are, they say, described in it with a truth that is almost profound; which did not prevent your Bonaparte from declaring on Saint Helena that it was a novel written for servants.' This speech restored all its activity to Julien's spirit. 'People have been trying to damage me with the Marechale; they have told her of my en- thusiasm for Napoleon. This intelligence has stung her sufficiently for her to yield to the temptation to let me feel her resentment.' This 16.Composed by Halevy upon a libretto by Scribe, and performed in 1830.

discovery kept him amused for the rest of the evening and made him amusing. As he was bidding the Marechale good night in the vestibule of the Opera: 'Bear in mind, Sir,' she said to him, 'that people must not love Napoleon when they love me; they may, at the most, accept him as a ne- cessity imposed by Providence. Anyhow, the man had not a soul pliant enough to feel great works of art.' 'When they love me!' Julien repeated to himself; 'either that means noth- ing at all, or it means everything. There is one of the secrets of language that are hidden from us poor provincials.' And he thought incessantly of Madame de Renal as he copied an immensely long letter intended for the Marechale. 'How is it,' she asked him the following evening, with an air of indif- ference which seemed to him unconvincing, 'that you speak to me of London and Richmond in a letter which you wrote last night, it appears, after leaving the Opera?' Julien was greatly embarrassed; he had copied the letter line for line, without thinking of what he was writing, and apparently had forgotten to substitute for the words London and Richmond, which occurred in the original, Paris and Saint-Cloud. He began two or three excuses, but found it impossible to finish any of them; he felt himself on the point of giving way to an outburst of helpless laughter. At length, in his search for the right words, he arrived at the following idea: 'Exalted by the discussion of the most sublime, the highest interests of the human soul, my own, in writing to you, must have become distracted. 'I am creating an impression,' he said to himself, 'therefore I can spare myself the tedium of the rest of the evening.' He left the Hotel de Fer- vaques in hot haste. That evening, as he looked over the original text of the letter which he had copied the night before, he very soon came to the fatal passage where the young Russian spoke of London and Richmond. Julien was quite surprised to find this letter almost tender. It was the contrast between the apparent frivolity of his talk and the sublime and almost apocalyptic profundity of his letters that had marked him out. The length of his sentences was especially pleasing to the Mare- chale; this was not the cursory style brought into fashion by Voltaire, that most immoral of men! Although our hero did everything in the world to banish any suggestion of common sense from his conversation, it had still an anti-monarchical and impious colour which did not escape the notice of Madame de Fervaques. Surrounded by persons who were eminently moral, but who often had not one idea in an evening, this lady was profoundly impressed by everything that bore a semblance of

novelty; but, at the same time, she felt that she owed it to herself to be shocked by it. She called this defect, 'retaining the imprint of the frivolity of the age'. But such drawing-rooms are worth visiting only when one has a fa- vour to ask. All the boredom of this life without interests which Julien was leading is doubtless shared by the reader. These are the barren moorlands on our journey. Throughout the time usurped in Julien's life by the Fervaques episode, Mademoiselle de La Mole had to make a constant effort not to think of him. Her heart was exposed to violent combats: sometimes she flattered herself that she was despising this gloomy young man; but, in spite of her efforts, his conversation captivated her. What astonished her most of all was his complete insincerity; he never uttered a word to the Mare- chale which was not a lie, or at least a shocking travesty of his point of view, which Mathilde knew so perfectly upon almost every subject. This Machiavellism impressed her. 'What profundity!' she said to herself; 'how different from the emphatic blockheads or the common rascals, like M. Tanbeau, who speak the same language!' Nevertheless, Julien passed some fearful days. It was to perform the most arduous of his duties that he appeared each evening in the Marechale's drawing-room. His efforts to play a part ended by sapping all his spiritual strength. Often, at night, as he crossed the vast courtyard of the Hotel de Fervaques, it was only by force of character and reason that he succeeded in keeping himself from sinking into despair. 'I conquered despair at the Seminary,' he said to himself: 'and yet what an appalling prospect I had before me then! I stood to make my fortune or to fail; in either case, I saw myself obliged to spend my whole life in the intimate society of all that is most contemptible and disgusting under heaven. The following spring, when only eleven short months had passed, I was perhaps the happiest of all the young men of my age.' But often enough all these fine arguments proved futile when faced with the frightful reality. Every day he saw Mathilde at luncheon and at dinner. From the frequent letters which M. de La Mole dictated to him, he knew her to be on the eve of marrying M. de Croisenois. Already that amiable young man was calling twice daily at the Hotel de La Mole: the jealous eye of an abandoned lover did not miss a single one of his actions. When he thought he had noticed that Mademoiselle de La Mole was treating her suitor kindly, on returning to his room, Julien could not help casting a loving glance at his pistols.

'Ah, how much wiser I should be,' he said to himself, 'to remove the marks from my linen, and retire to some lonely forest, twenty leagues from Paris, there to end this accursed existence! A stranger to the coun- tryside, my death would remain unknown for a fortnight, and who would think of me after a fortnight had passed?' This reasoning was extremely sound. But next day, a glimpse of Mathilde's arm, seen between her sleeve and her glove, was enough to plunge our young philosopher in cruel memories, which, at the same time, made him cling to life. 'Very well!' he would then say to himself, 'I shall follow out this Russian policy to the end. How is it going to end? 'As for the Marechale, certainly, after I have copied these fifty-three letters, I shall write no more. 'As for Mathilde, these six weeks of such painful play-acting, will either fail altogether to appease her anger, or will win me a moment of reconciliation. Great God! I should die of joy!' And he was unable to pur- sue the idea farther. When, after a long spell of meditation, he succeeded in recovering the use of his reason: 'Then,' he said to himself, 'I should obtain a day's hap- piness, after which would begin again her severities, founded, alas, upon the scant power that I have to please her, and I should be left without any further resource, I should be ruined, lost for ever ... 'What guarantee can she give me, with her character? Alas, my scant merit is responsible for everything. I must be wanting in elegance in my manners, my way of speaking must be heavy and monotonous. Great God! Why am I myself?'

Chapter Boredom Sacrificing oneself to one's passions is one thing; but to passions that one doesn't have! O sad nineteenth century! GIRODET After having read without pleasure at first Julien's long letters, Ma- dame de Fervaques began to take an interest in them; but one thing dis- tressed her: 'What a pity that M. Sorel is not really a priest! One could admit him to a sort of intimacy: with that Cross and what is almost a layman's coat, one is exposed to cruel questions, and how is one to an- swer them?' She did not complete her thought: 'some malicious friend may suppose and indeed spread the report that he is some humble little cousin, one of my father's family, some tradesman decorated by the Na- tional Guard.' Until the moment of her first meeting Julien, Madame de Fervaques's greatest pleasure had been to write the word Marechale before her own name. Thenceforward the vanity of an upstart, morbid and easily offen- ded, had to fight a nascent interest. 'It would be so easy for me,' the Marechale said to herself, 'to make a Vicar-General of him in some diocese not far from Paris! But M. Sorel by itself, and to add to that a mere secretary of M. de La Mole! It is deplorable.' For the first time, this spirit which dreaded everything was stirred by an interest apart from its own pretensions to rank and to social superiority. Her old porter noticed that, when he brought her a letter from that hand- some young man, who wore such a melancholy air, he was certain to see vanish the distracted and irritated expression which the Marechale al- ways took care to assume when any of her servants entered the room. The boredom of a mode of life whose sole ambition was to create an effect on the public, without there being at the bottom of her heart any real enjoyment of this kind of success, had become so intolerable since she had begun to think of Julien, that, if her maids were not to be ill-

treated throughout the whole of a day, it was enough that during the previous evening she should have spent an hour with this strange young man. His growing credit survived anonymous letters, very well com- posed. In vain did little Tanbeau supply MM. de Luz, de Croisenois, de Caylus, with two or three most adroit calumnies which those gentlemen took pleasure in spreading abroad, without stopping to consider the truth of the accusations. The Marechale, whose mind was not framed to withstand these vulgar methods, reported her doubts to Mathilde, and was always comforted. One day, after having inquired three times whether there were any let- ters, Madame de Fervaques suddenly decided to write to Julien. This was a victory gained by boredom. At the second letter, the Marechale was almost brought to a standstill by the unpleasantness of writing with her own hand so vulgar an address as: 'a M. Sorel, chez M. le Marquis de La Mole'. 'You must,' she said to Julien that evening in the driest of tones, 'bring me some envelopes with your address written on them.' 'So now I am to combine the lover and the flunkey,' thought Julien, and bowed, amusing himself by screwing up his face like Arsene, the Marquis's old footman. That same evening he brought a supply of envelopes, and next day, early in the morning, he received a third letter: he read five or six lines at the beginning, and two or three towards the end. It covered four pages in a small and very close script. Gradually she formed the pleasant habit of writing almost every day. Julien replied with faithful copies of the Russian letters, and, such is the advantage of the emphatic style, Madame de Fervaques was not at all surprised by the want of connection between the replies and her own letters. What would have been the irritation to her pride if little Tanbeau, who had appointed himself a voluntary spy upon Julien's actions, had been able to tell her that all these letters, with their seals unbroken, were flung pell-mell into Julien's drawer! One morning, the porter brought to him in the library a letter from the Marechale; Mathilde met the man, saw the letter, and read the address in Julien's hand. She entered the library as the porter left it; the letter was still lying on the edge of the table; Julien, busily engaged in writing, had not placed it in his drawer.

'This is what I cannot endure,' cried Mathilde, seizing the letter; 'you are forgetting me entirely, me who am your wife. Your conduct is ap- palling, Sir.' With these words, her pride, astonished by the fearful impropriety of her action, stifled her; she burst into tears, and a moment later appeared to Julien to be unable to breathe. Surprised, confounded, Julien did not clearly distinguish all the admir- able and happy consequences which this scene foreboded for himself. He helped Mathilde to a seat; she almost abandoned herself in his arms. The first instant in which he perceived this relaxation was one of ex- treme joy. His second thought was of Korasoff: 'I may ruin everything by a single word.' His arms ached, so painful was the effort imposed on him by policy. 'I ought not even to allow myself to press to my heart this supple and charming form, or she will despise and abuse me. What a frightful nature!' And as he cursed Mathilde's nature, he loved her for it a hundred times more; he felt as though he were holding a queen in his arms. Julien's unfeeling coldness intensified the misery of wounded pride which was tearing the heart of Mademoiselle de La Mole. She was far from possessing the necessary coolness to seek to read in his eyes what he was feeling for her at that moment. She could not bring herself to look at him; she trembled lest she should meet an expression of scorn. Seated on the divan in the library, motionless and with her head turned away from Julien, she was a prey to the keenest suffering that pride and love can make a human heart feel. Into what a frightful course of action had she fallen! 'It was reserved for me, wretch that I am, to see the most indelicate ad- vances repulsed! And repulsed by whom?' added a pride mad with suf- fering, 'by one of my father's servants. 'That is what I will not endure,' she said aloud. And, rising with fury, she opened the drawer of Julien's table, which stood a few feet away from her. She remained frozen with horror on see- ing there nine or ten letters unopened, similar in every respect to the let- ter which the porter had just brought in. On all the envelopes, she recog- nised Julien's hand, more or less disguised. 'And so,' she cried, beside herself with rage, 'not only have you found favour with her, but you despise her. You, a man of nought, to despise Madame la Marechale de Fervaques!

'Ah, forgive me, my dear,' she went on, flinging herself at his feet, 'despise me if you wish, but love me, I can no longer live deprived of your love.' And she fell to the ground in a dead faint. 'So there she is, that proud creature, at my feet!' thought Julien.

Chapter A Box at the Bouffes As the blackest sky Foretells the heaviest tempest. Don Juan, I. 73 In the thick of all this great commotion, Julien was more bewildered than happy. Mathilde's abuse of him showed him how wise the Russian policy had been. 'Say little, do little, that is my one way of salvation.' He lifted up Mathilde and without a word laid her down again on the divan. Gradually she gave way to tears. To keep herself in countenance, she took Madame de Fervaques's let- ters in her hands; she broke the seals slowly. She gave a nervous start on recognising the Marechale's handwriting. She turned over the sheets of these letters without reading them; the majority of them covered six pages. 'Answer me this, at least,' said Mathilde at length in the most supplic- ating tone, but without venturing to look at Julien. 'You know very well that I am proud; it is the misfortune of my position, and indeed of my nature, I must admit; so Madame de Fervaques has stolen your heart from me ... Has she offered you all the sacrifices to which that fatal pas- sion led me?' A grim silence was Julien's only answer. 'By what right,' he thought, 'does she ask of me an indiscretion unworthy of an honourable man?' Mathilde endeavoured to read the letters; the tears that filled her eyes made it impossible for her to do so. For a month past she had been miserable, but that proud spirit was far from confessing its feelings to itself. Chance alone had brought about this explosion. For an instant jealousy and love had overcome pride. She was seated upon the divan and in close proximity to him. He saw her hair and her throat of alabaster; for a moment he forgot all that he owed to himself; he slipped his arm round her waist, and almost hugged her to his bosom.

She turned her head towards him slowly: he was astonished at the in- tense grief that was visible in her eyes, and made them quite unrecognis- able as hers. Julien felt his strength begin to fail him, so colossal was the effort in- volved in the act of courage which he was imposing on himself. 'Those eyes will soon express nothing but the coldest disdain,' he said to himself, 'if I allow myself to be carried away by the joy of loving her.' Meanwhile, in a faint voice and in words which she had barely the strength to utter, she was repeating to him at that moment her assurance of all her regret for the action which an excessive pride might have coun- selled her to take. 'I too, have my pride,' Julien said to her in a voice that was barely artic- ulate, and his features indicated the extreme limit of physical exhaustion. Mathilde turned sharply towards him. The sound of his voice was a pleasure the hope of which she had almost abandoned. At that moment she recalled her pride only to curse it, she would fain have discovered some unusual, incredible act to prove to him how greatly she adored him and detested herself. 'It is probably because of that pride,' Julien went on, 'that you have singled me out for an instant; it is certainly because of that courageous firmness, becoming in a man, that you respect me at this moment. I may be in love with the Marechale ... ' Mathilde shuddered; her eyes assumed a strange expression. She was about to hear her sentence uttered. This movement did not pass unob- served by Julien; he felt his courage weaken. 'Ah!' he said to himself, listening to the sound of the vain words that came from his lips, as he might have listened to a noise from without; 'if I could only cover those pale cheeks with kisses, and you not feel them! 'I may be in love with the Marechale,' he continued ... and his voice grew fainter and fainter; 'but certainly, of her interest in myself I have no decisive proof... ' Mathilde gazed at him; he met her gaze, at least he hoped that his fea- tures had not betrayed him. He felt himself penetrated by love to the in- nermost recesses of his heart. Never had he adored her so intensely; he was scarcely less mad than Mathilde. Could she have found sufficient self-control and courage to manoeuvre, he would have fallen at her feet, forswearing all idle play-acting. He had strength enough to be able to continue to speak. 'Ah! Korasoff,' he exclaimed inwardly, 'why are not you here? How I need a word of advice to direct my conduct!' Mean- while his voice was saying:

'Failing any other sentiment, gratitude would suffice to attach me to the Marechale; she has shown me indulgence, she has comforted me when others scorned me ... I may perhaps not repose an unbounded faith in certain signs which are extremely flattering, no doubt, but also, perhaps, are of very brief duration.' 'Ah! Great God!' cried Mathilde. 'Very well! What guarantee will you give me?' Julien went on in sharp, firm accents, seeming to abandon for an instant the prudent forms of diplomacy. 'What guarantee, what god will assure me that the position which you seem disposed to restore to me at this moment will last for more than two days?' 'The intensity of my love and of my misery if you no longer love me,' she said, clasping his hands and turning her face towards him. The violent movement which she thus made had slightly displaced her pelerine: Julien caught a glimpse of her charming shoulders. Her hair, slightly disordered, recalled to him an exquisite memory ... He was about to yield. 'An imprudent word,' he told himself, 'and I be- gin once more that long succession of days passed in despair. Madame de Renal used to find reasons for obeying the dictates of her heart: this young girl of high society allows her heart to be moved only when she has proved to herself with good reasons that it ought to be moved.' He perceived this truth in a flash, and in a flash also regained his courage. He freed his hands which Mathilde was clasping in her own, and with marked respect withdrew a little way from her. Human courage can go no farther. He then busied himself in gathering together all Madame de Fervaques's letters which were scattered over the divan, and it was with a show of extreme politeness, so cruel at that moment, that he added: 'Mademoiselle de La Mole will deign to permit me to think over all this.' He withdrew rapidly and left the library; she heard him shut all the doors in turn. 'The monster is not in the least perturbed,' she said to herself... 'But what am I saying, a monster! He is wise, prudent, good; it is I who have done more wrong than could be imagined.' This point of view persisted. Mathilde was almost happy that day, for she was altogether in love; you would have said that never had that heart been stirred by pride—and such pride! She shuddered with horror when, that evening in the drawing-room, a footman announced Madame de Fervaques; the man's voice seemed to her to have a sinister sound. She could not endure the sight of the

Marechale, and quickly left the room. Julien, with little pride in his hard- won victory, had been afraid lest his own eyes should betray him, and had not dined at the Hotel de La Mole. His love and his happiness increased rapidly as the hour of battle re- ceded; he had already begun to find fault with himself. 'How could I res- ist her?' he asked himself; 'if she was going to cease to love me! A single moment may alter that proud spirit, and I must confess that I have treated her scandalously.' In the evening, he felt that he absolutely must appear at the Bouffes in Madame de Fervaques's box. She had given him an express invitation: Mathilde would not fail to hear of his presence there or of his discour- teous absence. Despite the self-evidence of this argument, he had not the strength, early in the evening, to plunge into society. If he talked, he would forfeit half his happiness. Ten o'clock struck: he must absolutely show his face. Fortunately he found the Marechale's box filled with women, and was relegated to a place by the door, and entirely concealed by their hats. This position saved him from making a fool of himself; the divine ac- cents of despair of Carolina in Il matrimonio segreto made him burst into tears. Madame de Fervaques saw these tears; they were in so marked a contrast to the manly firmness of his usual appearance, that this spirit of a great lady long saturated in all the most corrosive elements of the pride of an upstart was touched by them. What little she had left of a woman's heart led her to speak. She wished to enjoy the sound of her own voice at that moment. 'Have you seen the ladies de La Mole,' she said to him, 'they are in the third tier.' Instantly Julien bent forward into the house, leaning some- what rudely upon the ledge of the box: he saw Mathilde; her eyes were bright with tears. 'And yet it is not their day for the Opera,' thought Julien; 'what eagerness!' Mathilde had made her mother come to the Bouffes, despite the inferi- or position of the box which a sycophant of their circle had made haste to offer them. She wished to see whether Julien would spend that evening with the Marechale.

Chapter Making Her Afraid So this is the fine miracle of your civilisation! You have turned love into an ordinary matter. BARNAVE Julien hurried to Madame de La Mole's box. His eyes met first the tear- ful eyes of Mathilde; she was weeping without restraint, there was no one present but people of minor importance, the friend who had lent them the box and some men of her acquaintance. Mathilde laid her hand upon Julien's; she seemed to have forgotten all fear of her mother. Al- most stifled by her sobs, she said nothing to him but the single word: 'Guarantees!' 'Whatever I do, I must not speak to her,' thought Julien, greatly moved himself, and covering his eyes as best he could with his hand, ostensibly to avoid the lustre that was blazing into the boxes on the third tier. 'If I speak, she can no longer doubt the intensity of my emotion, the sound of my voice will betray me, all may be lost once more.' His struggles were far more painful than in the morning, his spirit had had time to grow disturbed. He was afraid of seeing Mathilde's vanity wounded. Frantic with love and passion, he pledged himself not to speak to her. This is, to my mind, one of the finest traits of his character; a person capable of such an effort to control himself may go far, si fata sinant. Mademoiselle de La Mole insisted upon taking Julien home. For- tunately it was raining in torrents. But the Marquise made him sit facing herself, talked to him continuously, and prevented his saying a word to her daughter. One would have thought that the Marquise was concerned for Julien's happiness; no longer afraid of destroying everything by the intensity of his emotion, he abandoned himself to it with frenzy. Dare I say that on entering his own room Julien threw himself on his knees and covered with kisses the love letters given him by Prince Korasoff?

'Oh, you great man! What do I not owe to you?' he cried in his frenzy. Gradually a little coolness returned to him. He compared himself to a general who had just won the first half of a great battle. 'The advantage is certain, immense,' he said to himself; 'but what is going to happen to- morrow? An instant may ruin everything.' He opened with a passionate impulse the Memoirs dictated at Saint Helena by Napoleon, and for two solid hours forced himself to read them; his eyes alone read the words, no matter, he forced himself to the task. During this strange occupation, his head and heart, rising to the level of everything that is most great, were at work without his knowledge. 'This is a very different heart from Madame de Renal's,' he said to himself, but he went no farther. 'Make her afraid,' he cried of a sudden, flinging the book from him. 'The enemy will obey me only so long as I make him fear me, then he will not dare to despise me.' He paced up and down his little room, wild with joy. To be frank, this happiness was due to pride rather than love. 'Make her afraid!' he repeated proudly to himself, and he had reason to be proud. 'Even in her happiest moments, Madame de Renal always doubted whether my love were equal to hers. Here, it is a demon that I am conquering, I must therefore conquer.' He knew well that next morning, by eight o'clock, Mathilde would be in the library; he did not appear there until nine, burning with love, but his head controlled his heart. Not a single minute passed, perhaps, without his repeating to himself: 'Always keep her mind occupied with the great uncertainty: "Does he love me?" Her privileged position, the flattery she receives from all who speak to her make her a little too much inclined to self-assurance.' He found her pale, calm, seated upon the divan, but incapable, appar- ently, of making any movement. She offered him her hand. 'Dear, I have offended you, it is true; you are perhaps vexed with me?' Julien was not expecting so simple a tone. He was on the point of be- traying himself. 'You wish for guarantees, dear,' she went on after a silence which she had hoped to see broken; 'that is only fair. Carry me off, let us start for London. I shall be ruined for ever, disgraced ... ' She found the courage to withdraw her hand from Julien so as to hide her eyes with it. All the sentiments of modesty and feminine virtue had returned to her heart ... 'Very well! Disgrace me,' she said at length with a sigh, 'it is a guarantee.'

'Yesterday I was happy, because I had the courage to be severe with myself,' thought Julien. After a brief interval of silence, he gained suffi- cient mastery over his heart to say in an icy tone: 'Once we are on the road to London, once you are disgraced, to use your own words, who can promise me that you will love me? That my company in the post-chaise will not seem to you an annoyance? I am not a monster, to have ruined your reputation will be to me only an addi- tional grief. It is not your position in society that is the obstacle, it is un- fortunately your own nature. Can you promise yourself that you will love me for a week? '(Ah! Let her love me for a week, for a week only,' Julien murmured to himself, 'and I shall die of joy. What do I care for the future, what do I care for life itself? And this divine happiness may begin at this moment if I choose, it depends entirely upon myself!)' Mathilde saw him turn pensive. 'So I am altogether unworthy of you,' she said, clasping his hand. Julien embraced her, but at once the iron hand of duty gripped his heart. 'If she sees how I adore her, then I lose her.' And, before with- drawing himself from her arms, he had resumed all the dignity that be- fits a man. On that day and the days that followed, he managed to conceal the in- tensity of his bliss; there were moments in which he denied himself even the pleasure of clasping her in his arms. At other moments, the frenzy of happiness swept aside all the counsels of prudence. It was beside a bower of honeysuckle arranged so as to hide the lad- der, in the garden, that he was accustomed to take his stand in order to gaze at the distant shutters of Mathilde's window and lament her incon- stancy. An oak of great size stood close by, and the trunk of this tree pre- vented him from being seen by indiscreet persons. As he passed with Mathilde by this spot which recalled to him so vividly the intensity of his grief, the contrast between past despair and present bliss was too strong for him; tears flooded his eyes, and, carrying to his lips the hand of his mistress: 'Here I lived while I thought of you; from here I gazed at that shutter, I awaited for hours on end the fortu- nate moment when I should see this hand open it ... ' He gave way completely. He portrayed to her, in those true colours which one does not invent, the intensity of his despair at that time. In spasmodic utterances he spoke of his present happiness which had put an end to that cruel suffering ...

'What am I doing, Great God!' said Julien, coming suddenly to his senses. 'I am destroying everything.' In the height of his alarm he thought he already saw less love in the eyes of Mademoiselle de La Mole. This was an illusion; but Julien's face changed rapidly and was flooded with a deathly pallor. His eyes grew dull for a moment, and an expression of arrogance not devoid of malice succeeded that of the most sincere, the most whole-hearted love. 'Why, what is the matter with you, dear?' Mathilde tenderly, anxiously inquired. 'I am lying,' said Julien savagely, 'and I am lying to you. I reproach myself for it, and yet God knows that I respect you sufficiently not to lie. You love me, you are devoted to me, and I have no need to make fine speeches in order to please you.' 'Great God! They were only fine speeches, all the exquisite things you have been saying to me for the last ten minutes?' 'And I reproach myself for them strongly, dear friend. I made them up long ago for a woman who loved me and used to bore me ... That is the weak spot in my character, I denounce myself to you, forgive me.' Bitter tears streamed down Mathilde's cheeks. 'Whenever some trifle that has shocked me sets me dreaming for a mo- ment,' Julien went on, 'my execrable memory, which I could curse at this moment, offers me a way of escape, and I abuse it.' 'So I have unconsciously done something that has displeased you?' said Mathilde with a charming simplicity. 'One day, I remember, as you passed by these honeysuckles, you plucked a flower, M. de Luz took it from you, and you let him keep it. I was close beside you.' 'M. de Luz? It is impossible,' replied Mathilde with the dignity that came so naturally to her: 'I never behave like that.' 'I am certain of it,' Julien at once rejoined. 'Ah, well! Then it must be true, dear,' said Mathilde, lowering her eyes sadly. She was positive that for many months past she had never al- lowed M. de Luz to take any such liberty. Julien gazed at her with an inexpressible tenderness: 'No,' he said to himself, 'she does not love me any the less.' She rebuked him that evening, with a laugh, for his fondness for Ma- dame de Fervaques: a bourgeois in love with a parvenue. 'Hearts of that class are perhaps the only ones that my Julien cannot inflame. She has turned you into a regular dandy,' she said, playing with his hair.

During the period in which he supposed himself to be scorned by Mathilde, Julien had become one of the best-dressed men in Paris. But he had an additional advantage over the other men of this sort; once his toi- let was performed, he never gave it another thought. One thing still vexed Mathilde. Julien continued to copy out the Russi- an letters, and to send them to the Marechale.

Chapter The Tiger Alas! why these things and not others! BEAUMARCHAIS An English traveller relates how he lived upon intimate terms with a tiger; he had reared it and used to play with it, but always kept a loaded pistol on the table. Julien abandoned himself to the full force of his happiness only at those moments when Mathilde could not read the expression of it in his eyes. He was punctilious in his performance of the duty of addressing a few harsh words to her from time to time. When Mathilde's meekness, which he observed with astonishment, and the intensity of her devotion came near to destroying all his self-con- trol, he had the courage to leave her abruptly. For the first time Mathilde was in love. Life, which had always crawled for her at a snail's pace, now flew. As it was essential, nevertheless, that her pride should find some out- let, she sought to expose herself with temerity to all the risks that her love could make her run. It was Julien who showed prudence; and it was only when there was any question of danger that she did not comply with his wishes; but, submissive, and almost humble towards him, she showed all the more arrogance towards anyone else who came near her in the house, relatives and servants alike. In the evenings in the drawing-room, she would summon Julien, and would hold long conversations with him in private. Little Tanbeau took his place one evening beside them; she asked him to go to the library and fetch her the volume of Smollett which dealt with the Revolution of 1688; and as he seemed to hesitate: There is no need to hurry,' she went on with an expression of insulting arrogance, which was balm to Julien's spirit. 'Did you notice the look in that little monster's eyes?' he asked her.

'His uncle has done ten or twelve years of service in this drawing- room, otherwise I should have him shown the door this instant.' Her behaviour towards MM. de Croisenois, de Luz, and the rest, per- fectly polite in form, was scarcely less provoking in substance. Mathilde blamed herself severely for all the confidences she had made to Julien in the past, especially as she did not dare confess to him that she had exag- gerated the almost wholly innocent marks of interest of which those gen- tlemen had been the object. In spite of the most admirable resolutions, her womanly pride preven- ted her every day from saying to Julien: 'It was because I was speaking to you that I found pleasure in the thought of my weakness in not with- drawing my hand when M. de Croisenois laid his hand on a marble table beside mine, and managed to touch it.' Nowadays, whenever one of these gentlemen had spoken to her for a few moments, she found that she had a question to ask Julien, and this was a pretext for keeping him by her side. She found that she was pregnant, and told the news joyfully to Julien. 'Now will you doubt me? Is not this a guarantee? I am your wife for ever.' This announcement filled Julien with profound astonishment. He was on the point of forgetting his principle of conduct. 'How can I be deliber- ately cold and offensive to this poor girl who is ruining herself for me?' Did she appear at all unwell, even on the days on which wisdom made her dread accents heard, he no longer found the courage to address to her one of those cruel speeches, so indispensable, in his experience, to the continuance of their love. 'I mean to write to my father,' Mathilde said to him one day; 'he is more than a father to me; he is a friend; and so I should feel it unworthy of you and of myself to seek to deceive him, were it only for a moment.' 'Great God! What are you going to do?' said Julien in alarm. 'My duty,' she replied, her eyes sparkling with joy. She felt herself to be more magnanimous than her lover. 'But he will turn me from the house in disgrace!' 'He is within his rights, we must respect them. I shall give you my arm, and we shall go out by the front door, in the full light of day.' Julien in astonishment begged her to wait for a week. 'I cannot,' she replied, 'the voice of honour speaks. I have seen what is my duty, I must obey, and at once.' 'Very well! I order you to wait,' said Julien at length. 'Your honour is covered, I am your husband. This drastic step is going to alter both our

positions. I also am within my rights. Today is Tuesday; next Tuesday is the day of the Duc de Retz's party; that evening, when M. de La Mole comes home, the porter shall hand him the fatal letter ... He thinks only of making you a Duchess, of that I am certain; think of his grief!' 'Do you mean by that: think of his revenge?' 'I may feel pity for my benefactor, distress at the thought of injuring him; but I do not and never shall fear any man.' Mathilde submitted. Since she had told Julien of her condition, this was the first time that he had spoken to her with authority; never had he loved her so dearly. It was with gladness that the softer side of his heart seized the pretext of Mathilde's condition to forgo the duty of saying a few cruel words. The idea of a confession to M. de La Mole disturbed him greatly. Was he going to be parted from Mathilde? And, however keen the distress with which she saw him go, a month after his departure would she give him a thought? He felt almost as great a horror of the reproaches which the Marquis might justly heap upon him. That evening, he admitted to Mathilde this second cause of his dis- tress, and then, carried away by love, admitted the other also. She changed colour. 'Indeed,' she said, 'six months spent out of my company would be a grief to you!' 'Immense, the only one in the world on which I look with terror.' Mathilde was delighted. Julien had played his part with such thor- oughness that he had succeeded in making her think that of the two she was the more in love. The fatal Tuesday came. At midnight, on returning home, the Marquis found a letter with the form of address which indicated that he was to open it himself, and only when he was unobserved. 'MY FATHER, 'Every social tie that binds us is broken, there remain only the ties of nature. After my husband, you are and will ever be the dearest person in the world to me. My eyes fill with tears, I think of the distress that I am causing you, but, that my shame may not be made public, to give you time to deliberate and act, I have been unable to postpone any further the confession that I owe you. If your affection for me, which I know to be extreme, chooses to allow me a small pension, I shall go and settle myself where you please, in Switzerland, for instance, with my husband. His name is so obscure that no one will recognise your daughter in Ma- dame Sorel, daughter-in-law of a carpenter of Verrieres. There you have

the name I have found it so hard to write. I dread, for Julien, your anger, apparently so righteous. I shall not be a Duchess, Father; but I knew it when I fell in love with him; for it was I that fell in love first, it was I who seduced him. I inherit from you a spirit too exalted to let my attention be arrested by what is or seems to me vulgar. It is in vain that with the idea of pleasing you I have thought of M. de Croisenois. Why did you place real merit before my eyes? You told me yourself on my return from Hyeres: "This young Sorel is the only person who amuses me"; the poor boy is as greatly distressed as myself, if it be possible, by the pain which this letter must cause you. I cannot prevent your being angry with me as a father; but care for me still as a friend. 'Julien respected me. If he spoke to me now and again, it was solely be- cause of his profound gratitude to you: for the natural pride of his char- acter leads him never to reply save officially to anyone who is placed so far above him. He has a strong and inborn sense of the differences of so- cial position. It was I, I admit, with a blush, to my best friend, and never shall such an admission be made to any other, it was I who one day in the garden pressed his arm. 'In twenty-four hours from now, why should you be angry with him? My fault is irreparable. If you require it, I shall be the channel to convey to you the assurances of his profound respect and of his distress at dis- pleasing you. You will not set eyes on him; but I shall go and join him wherever he may choose. It is his right, it is my duty, he is the father of my child. If in your generosity you are pleased to allow us six thousand francs upon which to live, I shall accept them with gratitude: otherwise, Julien intends to settle at Besancon where he will take up the profession of teacher of Latin and Literature. However low the degree from which he springs, I am certain that he will rise. With him, I have no fear of ob- scurity. If there be a Revolution, I am sure of a leading part for him. Could you say as much for any of those who have sought my hand? They have fine estates? I cannot find in that single circumstance a reason for admiration. My Julien would attain to a high position even under the present form of government, if he had a million and were protected by my father ... ' Mathilde, who knew that the Marquis was a man entirely governed by first impressions, had written eight pages. 'What is to be done?' Julien said to himself while M. de La Mole was reading this letter; 'where do, first of all, my duty, secondly, my interest lie? The debt that I owe him is immense: I should have been, but for him, a rascally understrapper, and not rascal enough to be hated and

persecuted by the rest. He has made me a man of the world. My neces- sary rascalities will be, first of all, rarer, and secondly, less ignoble. That is more than if he had given me a million. I owe to him this Cross and the record of so-called diplomatic services which have raised me above my rank. 'If he were to take his pen to prescribe my conduct, what would he write?' Julien was sharply interrupted by M. de La Mole's old valet. 'The Marquis wishes to see you this moment, dressed or undressed.' The valet added in an undertone as they were side by side: 'He is furi- ous, beware.'

Chapter The Torment of the Weak In cutting this diamond, a clumsy jeweller removed some of its brightest sparkles. In the Middle Ages, what am I saying? even under Richelieu, a Frenchman still had the power to desire. MIRABEAU Julien found the Marquis furious: for the first time in his life, perhaps, this gentleman was guilty of bad taste; he heaped on Julien all the insults that came to his lips. Our hero was astonished, irritated, but his sense of gratitude was not shaken. 'How many fine projects long cherished in his secret thoughts, the poor man sees crumble in an instant. But I owe it to him to answer him, my silence would increase his rage.' His answer was furnished for him from the part of Tartuffe. 'I am no angel ... I have served you well, you have rewarded me gener- ously ... I was grateful, but I am twenty-two years old ... In this house- hold, my thoughts were intelligible only to yourself, and to that obliging person ... ' 'Monster!' cried the Marquis. 'Obliging! Obliging! On the day when you found her obliging, you ought to have fled.' 'I made an attempt; I asked you if I might go to Languedoc.' Tired of pacing the room in fury, the Marquis, broken by grief, threw himself into an armchair; Julien heard him murmur to himself: 'This is no scoundrel.' 'No, I am not one to you,' cried Julien, falling at his feet. But he felt ex- tremely ashamed of this impulse and rose quickly. The Marquis was really out of his mind. On seeing this movement he began again to shower upon Julien atrocious insults worthy of a cab- driver. The novelty of these oaths was perhaps a distraction. 'What? My daughter is to be called Madame Sorel! What! My daughter is not to be a Duchess!' Whenever these two ideas presented themselves in such clear terms, the Marquis was in torment, and his impulses were uncontrolled. Julien began to fear a thrashing.

In his lucid intervals, and when the Marquis began to grow accus- tomed to his disgrace, his reproaches became quite reasonable. 'You ought to have gone, Sir,' he said. 'It was your duty to go ... You are the meanest of mankind ... ' Julien went to the table and wrote: 'For a long time my life has been insupportable, I am putting an end to it. I beg Monsieur le Marquis to accept, with my expression of a gratitude that knows no bounds, my apologies for the trouble which my death in his house may cause.' 'Will Monsieur le Marquis deign to peruse this paper ... Kill me,' said Julien, 'or have me killed by your valet. It is one o'clock in the morning, I am going to stroll in the garden towards the wall at the far end.' 'Go to the devil,' the Marquis shouted after him as he left the room. 'I understand,' thought Julien; 'he would not be sorry to see me spare his valet the responsibility for my death ... Let him kill me, well and good, it is a satisfaction that I am offering him ... But, by Jove, I am in love with life ... I owe myself to my child.' This idea, which for the first time appeared thus clearly before his ima- gination, completely absorbed him after the first few minutes of his stroll had been devoted to the sense of danger. This entirely novel interest made a prudent creature of him. 'I need ad- vice to guide me in dealing with that fiery man ... He has no judgment, he is capable of anything. Fouque is too far off, besides he would not un- derstand the sentiments of a heart like the Marquis's. 'Conte Altamira ... Can I be sure of eternal silence? My request for ad- vice must not be a definite action, nor complicate my position. Alas! There is no one left but the sombre abbe Pirard ... His mind is narrowed by Jansenism ... A rascally Jesuit would know the world better, and would be more to my purpose ... M. Pirard is capable of beating me, at the mere mention of my crime.' The genius of Tartuffe came to Julien's aid: 'Very well, I shall go and confess to him.' This was the resolution to which he finally came in the garden, after pacing it for fully two hours. He no longer thought that he might be surprised by a gunshot; sleep was overpowering him. Next morning, before daybreak, Julien was several leagues from Paris, knocking at the door of the stern Jansenist. He found, greatly to his as- tonishment, that the other was not unduly surprised at his confession. 'I ought perhaps to blame myself,' the abbe said to himself, more anxious than angry. 'I had thought that I detected this love affair. My

affection for yourself, you little wretch, restrained me from warning her father ... ' 'What will he do?' Julien asked him boldly. (At that moment, he loved the abbe and a scene would have been most painful to him.) 'I can see three courses of action,' Julien continued: 'First of all, M. de La Mole may have me put to death'; and he told the abbe of the letter an- nouncing his suicide which he had left with the Marquis; 'secondly, he may have me shot down by Comte Norbert, who will challenge me to a duel.' 'You would accept?' said the abbe in a fury, rising to his feet. 'You do not allow me to finish. Certainly I should never fire at the son of my benefactor. 'Thirdly, he may send me away. If he says to me: "Go to Edinburgh, to New York," I shall obey. Then they can conceal Mademoiselle de La Mole's condition; but I shall never allow them to destroy my child.' 'That, you may be sure, will be the first idea to occur to that corrupt man ... ' In Paris, Mathilde was in despair. She had seen her father about seven o'clock. He had shown her Julien's letter, she trembled lest he should have deemed it noble to put an end to his life: 'And without my permis- sion?' she said to herself with an agony which partook of anger. 'If he is dead, I shall die,' she said to her father. 'It is you that will be the cause of my death ... You will rejoice at it, perhaps ... But I swear to his ghost that I shall at once put on mourning, and shall be publicly Ma- dame veuve Sorel [the widow of M. Sorel], I shall send out the usual an- nouncements, you may count on that ... You will not find me pusillan- imous nor a coward.' Her love rose to the pitch of madness. It was now M. de La Mole's turn to be left speechless. He began to look upon what had happened more reasonably. At luncheon Mathilde did not put in an appearance. The Marquis was re- lieved of an immense burden, and flattered as well, when he discovered that she had said nothing to her mother. Julien dismounted from his horse. Mathilde sent for him, and flung herself into his arms almost in the sight of her maid. Julien was not un- duly grateful for this transport, he had come away most diplomatic and most calculating from his long conference with the abbe Pirard. His ima- gination was extinguished by the calculation of possibilities. Mathilde,

with tears in her eyes, informed him that she had seen the letter announ- cing his suicide. 'My father may change his mind; oblige me by setting off instantly for Villequier. Mount your horse, leave the premises before they rise from table.' As Julien did not in any way alter his air of cold astonishment, she burst into a flood of tears. 'Allow me to manage our affairs,' she cried to him with a transport, clasping him in her arms. 'You know very well that it is not of my own free will that I part from you. Write under cover to my maid, let the ad- dress be in a strange hand; as for me, I shall write you volumes. Farewell! Fly.' This last word wounded Julien, he obeyed nevertheless. 'It is fated,' he thought, 'that even in their best moments, these people must find a way of hurting me.' Mathilde put up a firm resistance to all her father's prudent plans. She steadfastly refused to set the negotiation upon any other basis than this: She was to be Madame Sorel, and would live in poverty with her hus- band in Switzerland, or with her father in Paris. She thrust from her the suggestion of a clandestine confinement. 'That would pave the way to the possibility of calumny and dishonour. Two months after our mar- riage, I shall travel abroad with my husband, and it will be easy for us to pretend that my child was born at a suitable date.' Received at first with transports of rage, this firmness ended by inspir- ing the Marquis with doubts. In a weak moment: 'Here,' he said to his daughter, 'is a transfer of ten thousand livres a year in the Funds, send it to your Julien, and let him speedily make it impossible for me to reclaim it.' To obey Mathilde, whose love of giving orders he knew, Julien had made an unnecessary journey of forty leagues: he was at Villequier, ex- amining the accounts of the agents; this generosity on the part of the Marquis was the occasion of his return. He went to seek asylum with the abbe Pirard, who, during his absence, had become Mathilde's most ef- fective ally. As often as he was interrogated by the Marquis, he proved to him that any other course than a public marriage would be a crime in the sight of God. 'And happily,' the abbe added, 'the wisdom of the world is here in ac- cordance with religion. Could you reckon for an instant, knowing the fiery character of Mademoiselle de La Mole, upon a secrecy which she had not imposed on herself? If you do not allow the frank course of a

public marriage, society will occupy itself for far longer with this strange misalliance. Everything must be stated at one time, without the least mystery, apparent or real.' 'It is true,' said the Marquis, growing pensive. 'By this method, to talk of the marriage after three days becomes the chatter of a man who lacks ideas. We ought to profit by some great anti-Jacobin measure by the Government to slip in unobserved in its wake.' Two or three of M. de La Mole's friends shared the abbe Pirard's view. The great obstacle, in their eyes, was Mathilde's decided nature. But in spite of all these specious arguments, the Marquis could not grow recon- ciled to abandoning the hope of a tabouret for his daughter. His memory and his imagination were full of all sorts of trickeries and pretences which had still been possible in his younger days. To yield to necessity, to go in fear of the law seemed to him an absurd thing and dis- honouring to a man of his rank. He was paying dearly for those enchant- ing dreams in which he had indulged for the last ten years as to the fu- ture of his beloved daughter. 'Who could have foreseen it?' he said to himself. 'A girl of so haughty a character, so elevated a mind, prouder than myself of the name she bears! One whose hand had been asked of me in advance by all the most illustratious blood in France! 'We must abandon all prudence. This age is destined to bring everything to confusion! We are marching towards chaos.'

Chapter A Man of Spirit The prefect riding along on his horse thought to himself, Why should I not be a minister, head of the Cabinet, a duke? This is how I would wage war ... In that way I would have innovators put in chains. Le Globe No argument is sufficient to destroy the mastery acquired by ten years of pleasant fancies. The Marquis thought it unreasonable to be angry, but could not bring himself to forgive. 'If this Julien could die by accident,' he said to himself at times ... Thus it was that his sorrowful imagination found some relief in pursuing the most absurd chimeras. They paralysed the influence of the wise counsels of the abbe Pirard. A month passed in this way without the slightest advance in the negotiations. In this family affair, as in affairs of politics, the Marquis had brilliant flashes of insight which would leave him enthusiastic for three days on end. At such times a plan of conduct would not please him because it was backed by sound reasons; the reasons found favour in his sight only in so far as they supported his favourite plan. For three days, he would labour with all the ardour and enthusiasm of a poet, to bring matters to a certain position; on the fourth, he no longer gave it a thought. At first Julien was disconcerted by the dilatoriness of the Marquis; but, after some weeks, he began to discern that M. de La Mole had, in dealing with this affair, no definite plan. Madame de La Mole and the rest of the household thought that Julien had gone into the country to look after the estates; he was in hiding in the abbe Pirard's presbytery, and saw Mathilde almost every day; she, each morning, went to spend an hour with her father, but sometimes they remained for weeks on end without mentioning the matter that was occupying all their thoughts. 'I do not wish to know where that man is,' the Marquis said to her one day; 'send him this letter.' Mathilde read:

'The estates in Languedoc bring in 20,600 francs. I give 10,600 francs to my daughter, and 10,000 francs to M. Julien Sorel. I make over the estates themselves, that is to say. Tell the lawyer to draft two separate deeds of gift, and to bring me them tomorrow; after which, no further relations between us. Ah! Sir, how was I to expect such a thing as this? 'LE MARQUIS DE LA MOLE' 'I thank you very much,' said Mathilde gaily. 'We are going to settle in the Chateau d'Aiguillon, between Agen and Marmande. They say that the country there is as beautiful as Italy.' This donation came as a great surprise to Julien. He was no longer the severe, cold man that we have known. The destiny of his child absorbed all his thoughts in anticipation. This unexpected fortune, quite consider- able for so poor a man, made him ambitious. He now saw, settled on his wife or himself, an income of 30,600 francs. As for Mathilde, all her senti- ments were absorbed in one of adoration of her husband, for thus it was that her pride always named Julien. Her great, her sole ambition was to have her marriage recognised. She spent her time in exaggerating the high degree of prudence that she had shown in uniting her destiny with that of a superior man. Personal merit was in fashion in her brain. Their almost continuous separation, the multiplicity of business, the little time that they had to talk of love, now completed the good effect of the wise policy adopted by Julien in the past. Finally Mathilde grew impatient at seeing so little of the man whom she had now come to love sincerely. In a moment of ill humour she wrote to her father, and began her letter like Othello: 'That I have preferred Julien to the attractions which society offered to the daughter of M. le Marquis de La Mole, my choice of him sufficiently proves. These pleasures of reputation and petty vanity are nothing to me. It will soon be six weeks that I have lived apart from my husband. That is enough to prove my respect for you. Before next Thursday, I shall leave the paternal roof. Your generosity has made us rich. No one knows my secret save the estimable abbe Pirard. I shall go to him; he will marry us, and an hour after the ceremony we shall be on our way to Langue- doc, and shall never appear again in Paris save by your order. But what pierces me to the heart is that all this will furnish a savoury anecdote at my expense, and at yours. May not the epigrams of a foolish public ob- lige our excellent Norbert to seek a quarrel with Julien? In that event, I know him, I should have no control over him. We should find in his heart the plebeian in revolt. I implore you on my knees, O my father,

come and attend our wedding, in M. Pirard's church, next Thursday. The point of the malicious anecdote will be blunted, and the life of your only son, my husband's life will be made safe,' etc., etc. This letter plunged the Marquis in a strange embarrassment. He must now at length make up his mind. AH his little habits, all his common- place friends had lost their influence. In these strange circumstances, the salient features of his character, stamped upon it by the events of his younger days, resumed their full sway. The troubles of the Emigration had made him a man of imagina- tion. After he had enjoyed for two years an immense fortune and all the distinctions of the Court, 1790 had cast him into the fearful hardships of the Emigration. This hard school had changed the heart of a man of two and twenty. Actually he was encamped amid his present wealth rather than dominated by it. But this same imagination which had preserved his soul from the gangrene of gold, had left him a prey to an insane pas- sion for seeing his daughter adorned with a fine-sounding title. During the six weeks that had just elapsed, urged at one moment by a caprice, the Marquis had decided to enrich Julien; poverty seemed to him ignoble, dishonouring to himself, M. de La Mole, impossible in the husband of his daughter; he showered money upon him. Next day, his imagination taking another direction, it seemed to him that Julien would hear the silent voice of this generosity in the matter of money, change his name, retire to America, write to Mathilde that he was dead to her. M. de La Mole imagined this letter as written, and traced its effect on his daughter's character ... On the day on which he was awakened from these youthful dreams by Mathilde's real letter, after having long thought of killing Julien or of making him disappear, he was dreaming of building up for him a bril- liant future. He was making him take the name of one of his properties; and why should he not secure the transmission of his peerage to him? M. le Duc de Chaulnes, his father-in-law, had spoken to him several times, since his only son had been killed in Spain, of wishing to hand on his title to Norbert ... 'One cannot deny that Julien shows a singular aptitude for business, audacity, perhaps even brilliance,' the Marquis said to himself... 'But at the back of that character, I find something alarming. It is the impression that he produces on everyone, therefore there must be something real in it' (the more difficult this reality was to grasp, the more it alarmed the imaginative spirit of the old Marquis).

'My daughter expressed it to me very cleverly the other day' (in a letter which we have suppressed): '"Julien belongs to no drawing-room, to no set." He has not contrived to find any support against me, not the slight- est resource if I abandon him ... But is that due to ignorance of the actual state of society? Two or three times I have said to him: "There is no real and profitable candidature save that of the drawing-rooms ... " 'No, he has not the adroit and cautious spirit of a pettifogger who nev- er loses a minute or an opportunity ... It is not at all the character of a Louis XI. On the other hand, I see in him the most ungenerous max- ims ... I lose track of him ... Does he repeat those maxims to himself, to serve as a dam to his passions? 'Anyhow, one thing is clear: he cannot endure contempt, in that way I hold him. 'He has not the religious feeling for high birth, it is true, he does not re- spect us by instinct ... That is bad; but, after all, the heart of a seminarist should be impatient only of the want of pleasure and money. He is very different; he cannot endure contempt at any price.' Forced by his daughter's letter, M. de La Mole saw the necessity of making up his mind: 'Well, here is the great question: has Julien's auda- city gone the length of setting him to make love to my daughter, because he knows that I love her more than anything in the world, and that I have an income of a hundred thousand crowns? 'Mathilde protests the opposite ... No, master Julien, that is a point upon which I wish to be under no illusion. 'Has there been genuine, unpremeditated love? Or rather a vulgar de- sire to raise himself to a good position? Mathilde is perspicacious, she felt from the first that this suspicion might ruin him with me; hence that admission: it was she who thought first of loving him ... 'That a girl of so lofty a character should so far have forgotten herself as to make tangible advances! ... Press his arm in the garden, one even- ing, how horrible! As though she had not had a hundred less indelicate ways of letting him know that she favoured him. 'To excuse is to accuse; I distrust Mathilde ... ' That day, the Marquis's arguments were more conclusive than usual. Habit, however, prevailed; he resolved to gain time and to write to his daughter; for they commu- nicated by letter between different parts of the house. M. de La Mole dared not discuss matters with Mathilde and hold out against her. He was afraid of bringing everything to an end by a sudden concession. 'Take care not to commit any fresh act of folly; here is a commission as Lieutenant of Hussars for M. le Chevalier Julien Sorel de La Vernaye.

You see what I am doing for him. Do not cross me, do not question me. He shall start within twenty-four hours, and report himself at Stras- bourg, where his regiment is quartered. Here is a draft upon my banker; I expect obedience.' Mathilde's love and joy knew no bounds; she sought to profit by her victory and replied at once: 'M. de La Vernaye would be at your feet, speechless with gratitude, if he knew all that you are deigning to do for him. But, in the midst of this generosity, my father has forgotten me; your daughter's honour is in danger. A single indiscretion may leave an everlasting blot, which an in- come of twenty thousand crowns would not efface. I shall send this com- mission to M. de La Vernaye only if you give me your word that, in the course of the next month, my marriage shall be celebrated in public, at Villequier. Soon after that period, which I beg you not to prolong, your daughter will be unable to appear in public save with the name of Ma- dame de La Vernaye. How I thank you, dear Papa, for having saved me from the name of Sorel,' etc., etc. The reply was unexpected. 'Obey or I retract all. Tremble, rash girl, I do not yet know what your Julien is, and you yourself know even less than I. Let him start for Stras- bourg, and put his best foot foremost. I shall make my wishes known in a fortnight's time.' The firmness of this reply astonished Mathilde. 'I do not know Julien'; these words plunged her in a day-dream which presently ended in the most enchanting suppositions; but she believed them to be the truth. 'My Julien's mind has not donned the tawdry little uniform of the drawing- rooms, and my father disbelieves in his superiority because of the very fact which proves it ... 'Anyhow, if I do not obey this sudden impulse, I foresee the possibility of a public scene; a scandal lowers my position in society, and may make me less attractive in Julien's eyes. After the scandal ... ten years of poverty; and the folly of choosing a husband on account of his merit can only be saved from ridicule by the most brilliant opulence. If I live apart from my father, at his age, he may forget me ... Norbert will marry some attractive, clever woman: the old Louis XIV was beguiled by the Duchesse de Bourgogne ... ' She decided to obey, but refrained from communicating her father's letter to Julien; his unaccountable nature might lead him to commit some act of folly.

That evening, when she informed Julien that he was a Lieutenant of Hussars, his joy knew no bounds. We may form an idea of it from the ambition that marked his whole life, and from the passionate love that he now felt for his child. The change of name filled him with astonishment. 'At last,' he thought, 'the tale of my adventures is finished, and the credit is all mine. I have contrived to make myself loved by this monster of pride,' he added, looking at Mathilde; 'her father cannot live without her, nor she without me.'

Chapter A Storm My God, give me mediocrity! MIRABEAU He was completely absorbed; he made only a half-hearted response to the keen affection that she showed for him. He remained taciturn and sombre. Never had he appeared so great, so adorable in the eyes of Mathilde. She feared some subtle refinement of his pride which would presently upset the whole position. Almost every morning, she saw the abbe Pirard come to the Hotel. Through his agency might not Julien have penetrated to some extent into her father's intentions? Might not the Marquis himself, in a moment of caprice, have written to him? After so great a happiness, how was she to account for Julien's air of severity? She dared not question him. Dared not! She, Mathilde! There was, from that moment, in her feeling for Julien, something vague, unaccountable, almost akin to terror. That sere heart felt all the passion that is possible in one brought up amid all that excess of civilisation which Paris admires. Early next morning, Julien was in the abbe Pirard's presbytery. A pair of post-horses arrived in the courtyard drawing a dilapidated chaise, hired at the nearest post. 'Such an equipage is no longer in keeping,' the stern abbe told him, with a cantankerous air. 'Here are twenty thousand francs, of which M. de La Mole makes you a present; he expects you to spend them within the year, but to try and make yourself as little ridiculous as possible.' (In so large a sum, bestowed on a young man, the priest saw only an occa- sion of sin.) 'The Marquis adds: "M. Julien de La Vernaye will have received this money from his father, whom there is no use in my identifying more pre- cisely. M. de La Vernaye will doubtless think it proper to make a present to M. Sorel, carpenter at Verrieres, who looked after him in his child- hood ... " I will undertake this part of the commission,' the abbe went on;

'I have at last made M. de La Mole decide to compromise with that abbe de Frilair, who is such a Jesuit. His position is unquestionably too strong for us. The implicit recognition of your noble birth by that man who gov- erns Besancon will be one of the implied conditions of the arrangement.' Julien was no longer able to control his enthusiasm, he embraced the abbe, he saw himself recognised. 'Fie!' said M. Pirard, and thrust him away; 'what is the meaning of this worldly vanity? As for Sorel and his sons, I shall offer them, in my name, an annual pension of five hundred francs, which will be paid to each of them separately, so long as I am satisfied with them.' Julien was by this time cold and stiff. He thanked the abbe, but in the vaguest terms and without binding himself to anything. 'Can it indeed be possible,' he asked himself, 'that I am the natural son of some great nobleman, banished among our mountains by the terrible Napoleon?' Every moment this idea seemed to him less improbable ... 'My hatred for my father would be a proof ... I should no longer be a monster!' A few days after this monologue, the Fifteenth Regiment of Hussars, one of the smartest in the Army, was drawn up in order of battle on the parade ground of Strasbourg. M. le Chevalier de La Vernaye was moun- ted upon the finest horse in Alsace, which had cost him six thousand francs. He had joined as Lieutenant, without having ever been a Second Lieutenant, save on the muster-roll of a Regiment of which he had never even heard. His impassive air, his severe and almost cruel eyes, his pallor, his un- alterable coolness won him a reputation from the first day. In a short time, his perfect and entirely measured courtesy, his skill with the pistol and sabre, which he made known without undue affectation, removed all temptation to joke audibly at his expense. After five or six days of hesitation, the general opinion of the Regiment declared itself in his fa- vour. 'This young man has everything,' said the older officers who were inclined to banter, 'except youth.' > From Strasbourg, Julien wrote to M. Chelan, the former cure of Verri- eres, who was now reaching the extreme limits of old age: 'You will have learned with a joy, of which I have no doubt, of the events that have led my family to make me rich. Here are five hundred francs which I beg you to distribute without display, and with no men- tion of my name, among the needy, who are poor now as I was once, and whom you are doubtless assisting as in the past you assisted me.'

Julien was intoxicated with ambition and not with vanity; he still ap- plied a great deal of his attention to his outward appearance. His horses, his uniforms, the liveries of his servants were kept up with a nicety which would have done credit to the punctiliousness of a great English nobleman. Though only just a Lieutenant, promoted by favour and after two days' service, he was already calculating that, in order to be Com- mander in Chief at thirty, at latest, like all the great Generals, he would need at three and twenty to be something more than Lieutenant. He could think of nothing but glory and his son. It was in the midst of the transports of the most frenzied ambition that he was interrupted by a young footman from the Hotel de La Mole, who arrived with a letter. 'All is lost,' Mathilde wrote to him; 'hasten here as quickly as possible, sacrifice everything, desert if need be. As soon as you arrive, wait for me in a cab, outside the little gate of the garden, No.— Rue ——. I shall come out to speak to you; perhaps I may be able to let you into the garden. All is lost, and, I fear, beyond hope of repair; count upon me, you will find me devoted and steadfast in adversity. I love you.' In a few minutes, Julien obtained leave from his Colonel, and left Strasbourg at a gallop; but the fearful anxiety which was devouring him did not allow him to continue this method of travel farther than Metz. He flung himself into a post-chaise; and it was with an almost incredible rapidity that he arrived at the appointed place, outside the little gate of the garden of the Hotel de La Mole. The gate was flung open, and in a moment, Mathilde, forgetting all self-respect, threw herself into his arms. Fortunately, it was but five o'clock in the morning and the street was still deserted. 'All is lost; my father, dreading my tears, went away on Thursday night. Where? No one knows. Here is his letter; read it.' And she got into the cab with Julien. 'I could forgive everything, except the plan of seducing you because you are rich. That, unhappy girl, is the appalling truth. I give you my word of honour that I will never consent to a marriage with that man. I promise him an income of ten thousand livres if he consents to live abroad, beyond the frontiers of France, or better still in America. Read the letter which I have received in reply to a request for information. The shameless scoundrel had himself invited me to write to Madame de Ren- al. Never will I read a line from you about the man. I have a horror of Paris and of you. I request you to cloak with the greatest secrecy what

must shortly happen. Renounce honestly a vile fellow, and you will re- gain a father.' 'Where is Madame de Renal's letter?' said Julien coldly. 'Here it is. I did not wish to show it to you until you were prepared.' LETTER 'What I owe to the sacred cause of religion and morals obliges me, Sir, to the painful step which I take in addressing you; a rule, which admits of no relaxation, orders me at this moment to do harm to my neighbour, but in order to avoid a greater scandal. The grief which I feel must be overborne by a sense of duty. It is only too true, Sir, the conduct of the person with regard to whom you ask me to tell the whole truth may have seemed inexplicable or indeed honourable. It may have been thought expedient to conceal or to disguise a part of the truth, prudence required this as well as religion. But that conduct, which you desire to know, has been in fact extremely reprehensible, and more so than I can say. Poor and avaricious, it is by the aid of the most consummate hypo- crisy, and by the seduction of a weak and unhappy woman, that this man has sought to make a position for himself and to become somebody. It is a part of my painful duty to add that I am obliged to believe that M. J—— has no religious principles. I am bound in conscience to think that one of his avenues to success in a household is to seek to seduce the wo- man who has most influence there. Cloaked by a show of disinterested- ness and by phrases from novels, his great and sole object is to contrive to secure control over the master of the house and over his fortune. He leaves in his wake misery and undying regret,' etc., etc., etc. This letter, extremely long and half obliterated by tears, was certainly in the hand of Madame de Renal; it was even written with greater care than usual. 'I cannot blame M. de La Mole,' said Julien when he had finished read- ing it; 'he is just and prudent. What father would give his beloved daughter to such a man! Farewell!' Julien sprang out of the cab, and ran to his post-chaise which had drawn up at the end of the street. Mathilde, whom he seemed to have forgotten, followed him for a little way; but the sight of the tradesmen who were coming to the doors of their shops, and to whom she was known, forced her to retire in haste into the garden. Julien had set off for Verrieres. On this rapid journey, he was unable to write to Mathilde as he had intended, his hand traced nothing more than an illegible scrawl on the paper.

He arrived at Verrieres on a Sunday morning. He entered the shop of the local gunsmith, who congratulated him effusively on his recent ac- cess to fortune. It was the talk of the town. Julien had some difficulty in making him understand that he required a brace of pistols. The gunsmith, at his request, loaded the pistols. The three bells sounded; this is a signal well known in French villages, which, after the various peals of the morning, announces that mass is just about to begin. Julien entered the new church of Verrieres. All the tall windows of the building were screened by crimson curtains. He found himself standing a few yards behind Madame de Renal's bench. He had the impression that she was praying with fervour. The sight of this woman who had loved him so dearly made Julien's arm tremble so violently that he could not at first carry out his design. 'I cannot,' he said to himself; 'I am phys- ically incapable of it.' At that moment, the young clerk who was serving mass rang the bell for the Elevation. Madame de Renal bowed her head which for a mo- ment was almost entirely concealed by the folds of her shawl. Her aspect was less familiar to Julien; he fired a shot at her with one pistol and missed her, he fired a second shot; she fell.

Chapter Painful Details Do not look for any weakness on my part. I have avenged myself. I have deserved death, and here I am. Pray for my soul. SCHILLER Julien remained motionless, seeing nothing. When he came to himself a little, he noticed the whole congregation rushing from the church; the priest had left the altar. Julien set off at a leisurely pace in the wake of some women who were screaming as they went. One woman, who was trying to escape faster than the rest, gave him a violent push; he fell. His feet were caught in a chair overturned by the crowd; as he rose, he felt himself gripped by the collar; it was a gendarme in full uniform who was arresting him. Mechanically Julien's hand went to his pocket pistols; but a second gendarme seized him by the arms. He was led away to prison. They took him into a room, put irons on his wrists, and left him by himself; the door was shut on him and double-locked; all this was carried out quickly, and he remained uncon- scious of it. 'Faith, all is over,' he said aloud on coming to himself... 'Yes, in a fort- night the guillotine ... or suicide between now and then.' His reasoning went no farther; he felt a pain in his head as though it had been gripped with violence. He looked round to see if anyone was holding it. A few moments later, he fell into a deep slumber. Madame de Renal was not mortally wounded. The first bullet had passed through her hat; as she turned round, the second shot had been fired. This bullet had struck her in the shoulder, and, what was surpris- ing, had glanced back from the shoulder-blade, which nevertheless it shattered, against a gothic pillar, from which it broke off a huge splinter of stone. When, after a long and painful examination, the surgeon, a grave man, said to Madame de Renal: 'I answer for your life as for my own,' she was deeply affected.

For a long time she had sincerely longed for death. The letter which she had been ordered to write by her confessor of the moment, and had written to M. de La Mole, had dealt the final blow to this creature weakened by an ever-present sorrow. This sorrow was Julien's absence; she herself called it remorse. Her director, a young cleric, virtuous and fervent, recently arrived from Dijon, was under no illusion. 'To die thus, but not by my own hand, is not a sin,' thought Madame de Renal. 'God will pardon me perhaps for rejoicing in my death.' She dared not add: 'And to die by the hand of Julien is the acme of bliss.' As soon as she was rid of the presence of the surgeon, and of all her friends who had come crowding round her, she sent for Elisa, her maid. 'The gaoler,' she said to her, blushing deeply, 'is a cruel man. Doubt- less he intends to maltreat him, thinking that by so doing he will be pleasing me ... The thought of such a thing is unendurable. Could you not go, as though on your own behalf, and give the gaoler this packet which contains a few louis? You will tell him that religion does not per- mit his maltreating him ... But on no account must he mention this gift of money.' It was to this circumstance that Julien was indebted for the humanity of the gaoler of Verrieres; he was still that M. Noiroud, the loyal support- er of the government, whom we have seen thrown into such a panic by the arrival of M. Appert. A magistrate appeared in the prison. 'I have taken life with premedita- tion,' Julien said to him; 'I bought the pistols and had them loaded by So- and-so, the gunsmith. Article 1342. of the Penal Code is quite clear, I de- serve death and await it.' The magistrate, surprised by the character of this reply, sought to multiply his questions so that the accused might contradict himself in his answers. 'But don't you see,' Julien said to him with a smile, 'that I am making myself out as guilty as you can wish? Go, Sir, you shall not lack the quarry that you are pursuing. You shall have the pleasure of passing sen- tence. Spare me your presence. 'I have still a tiresome duty to perform,' thought Julien, 'I must write to Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'I have avenged myself,' he told her. 'Unfortunately, my name will ap- pear in the newspapers, and I cannot escape from this world incognito. I shall die within two months. My revenge has been terrible, like the grief of being parted from you. From this moment, I forbid myself to write and to utter your name. Never speak of me, even to my son: silence is the only way of honouring me. To the average man I shall be a common

murderer ... Allow me to tell the truth in this supreme moment: you will forget me. This great catastrophe, as to which I recommend you never to open your lips to a living soul, will suppress for some years all the ro- mantic and unduly adventurous element that I saw in your character. You were made to live among the heroes of the Middle Ages; show in this crisis their firmness of character. Let what is bound to happen be ac- complished in secret and without compromising you. You will take a false name and dispense with a confidant. If you must absolutely have the assistance of a friend, I bequeath to you the abbe Pirard. 'Do not speak to anyone else, especially to men of your own class; de Luz or Caylus. 'A year after my death, marry M. de Croisenois; I order you as your husband. Do not write to me at all, I should not answer you. Though far less of a villain than Iago, or so it seems to me, I shall say like him: From this time forth I never will speak word. 'No one shall see me either speak or write; you will have had my last words, with my last adoration. 'J. S.' It was after he had sent off this letter that for the first time, Julien, hav- ing slightly recovered himself, became extremely unhappy. One by one, each of the hopes of his ambition must be wrenched from his heart by those solemn words: 'I am to die.' Death, in itself, was not horrible in his eyes. His whole life had been merely a long preparation for misfortune, and he had certainly never forgotten what is reckoned the greatest mis- fortune of all. 'Why!' he said to himself, 'if in sixty days I had to fight a duel with a man who was a champion fencer, should I be so weak as to think of it in- cessantly and with terror in my soul?' He spent more than an hour in seeking to discover his exact senti- ments in this connection. When he had seen clearly into his soul, and the truth appeared before his eyes as sharply defined as one of the pillars of his prison, he thought of remorse. 'Why should I feel any? I have been outraged in a terrible manner; I have taken life, I deserve death, but that is all. I die after having paid my reckoning with humanity. I leave behind me no unfulfilled obligation, I owe nothing to anyone; there is nothing shameful in my death but the in- strument of it: that by itself, it is true, will amply suffice to shame me in the eyes of the townsfolk of Verrieres; but, from an intellectual point of view, what could be more contemptible? There remains one way of

acquiring distinction in their eyes: namely, by scattering gold coins among the crowd on my way to the scaffold. My memory, linked with the thought of gold, will then be resplendent to them.' After this consideration, which at the end of a minute seemed to him conclusive: 'I have nothing more to do on earth,' Julien said to himself and fell into a deep slumber. About nine o'clock in the evening, the gaoler awakened him by bring- ing in his supper. 'What are they saying in Verrieres?' 'Monsieur Julien, the oath that I took before the Crucifix, in the King's court, the day I was installed in my post, compels me to keep silence.' He was silent, but remained in the room. The spectacle of this vulgar hypocrisy amused Julien. 'I must,' he thought, 'keep him waiting a long time for the five francs which he wants as the price of his conscience.' When the gaoler saw the meal come to an end without any attempt at corruption: 'The friendship that I feel for you, Monsieur Julien,' he began, with a false, winning air, 'obliges me to speak; although they may say that it is against the interests of justice, because it may help you to arrange your defence ... Monsieur Julien, who has a good heart, will be glad if I tell him that Madame de Renal is going on well.' 'What! She is not dead?' cried Julien, beside himself with amazement. 'What! Didn't you know?' said the gaoler with an air of stupidity which presently turned to one of joyful greed. 'It would only be right for Monsieur to give something to the surgeon who, according to law and justice, ought not to speak. But, to oblige Monsieur, I went to his house, and he told me everything ... ' 'In short, the injury is not mortal,' said Julien, losing patience, 'you an- swer for that with your life?' The gaoler, a giant six feet in stature, took fright and retreated towards the door. Julien saw that he was going the wrong way to reach the truth, he sat down again and tossed a napoleon to M. Noiroud. As the man's story began to convince Julien that Madame de Renal's injury was not mortal, he felt himself overcome by tears. 'Leave me!' he said suddenly. The gaoler obeyed. As soon as the door was shut: 'Great God! She is not dead!' exclaimed Julien; and he fell on his knees, weeping hot tears. In this supreme moment he was a believer. What matter the hypocris- ies of the priests? Can they destroy anything of the truth and sublimity of the idea of God?

Only then did Julien begin to repent of the crime that he had commit- ted. By a coincidence which saved him from despair, at that moment only had passed away the state of irritation and semi-insanity in which he had been plunged since leaving Paris for Verrieres. His tears sprang from a generous source, he had no doubt as to the sentence that was in store for him. 'And so she will live!' he said to himself ... 'She will live to pardon me and to love me.' Late next morning, when the gaoler awakened him: 'You must have a wonderful heart, Monsieur Julien,' the man said to him. 'Twice I have come in and did not want to wake you. Here are two bottles of excellent wine which M. Maslon, our cure, sends you.' 'What? Is that rascal here still?' said Julien. 'Yes, Sir,' replied the gaoler, lowering his voice, 'but do not speak so loud, it may damage you.' Julien laughed heartily. 'At the stage I have reached, my friend, you alone could damage me, if you ceased to be gentle and human ... You shall be well paid,' Julien broke off, resuming his imperious air. This air was immediately justified by the gift of a small coin. M. Noiroud told him once more, going into the fullest detail, all that he had heard about Madame de Renal, but he did not mention Miss Elisa's visit. This man was as menial and submissive as possible. An idea came into Julien's head: 'This sort of ungainly giant may earn three or four hundred francs, for his prison is never crowded; I can guarantee him ten thousand francs, if he cares to escape to Switzerland with me ... The difficulty will be to persuade him of my sincerity.' The thought of the long colloquy that he would have to hold with so vile a creature filled Julien with dis- gust, he turned his mind to other things. That evening, there was no longer time. A post-chaise came to fetch him at midnight. He was charmed with the gendarmes, his travelling companions. In the morning, when he arrived at the prison of Besancon, they were so kind as to lodge him on the upper floor of a gothic dun- geon. He guessed the architecture to date from the beginning of the four- teenth century; he admired its grace and pointed airiness. Through a nar- row gap between two walls on the farther side of a deep courtyard, there was a glimpse of a superb view.

Next day he was examined, after which, for several days, he was left to himself. His spirit was calm. He could find nothing that was not quite simple in his case: 'I sought to kill, I must be killed.' His thoughts did not linger to consider this argument. The trial, the annoyance of appearing in public, the defence, he regarded as so many trifling embarrassments, tiresome ceremonies of which it would be time to think when the day came. The prospect of death detained him almost as little: 'I shall think of that after the sentence.' Life was by no means te- dious to him, he looked at everything in a fresh light. He had no ambi- tion left. He thought rarely of Mademoiselle de La Mole. His remorse oc- cupied him a great deal and often called up before him the image of Ma- dame de Renal, especially in the silence of the night, disturbed only, in this lofty dungeon, by the cry of the osprey! He thanked heaven for not having let him wound her mortally. 'An as- tonishing thing!' he said to himself, 'I thought that by her letter to M. de La Mole she had destroyed my future happiness for all time, and, in less than a fortnight after the date of that letter, I no longer think of all that was occupying my mind ... Two or three thousand livres a year to live quietly in a mountain village like Vergy ... I was happy then ... I did not recognise my own happiness!' At other moments, he would rise with a bound from his chair. 'If I had wounded Madame de Renal mortally, I should have killed myself ... I re- quire that certainty to make me feel a horror of myself. ,,, 'Kill myself! That is the great question,' he said to himself. Those judges so steeped in formalities, so thirsty for the blood of the wretched prisoner, who would have the best of citizens hanged in order to hang a Cross from their own buttonholes ... I should remove myself from their power, from their insults in bad French, which the local newspaper will proceed to call eloquence. 'I may live for five or six weeks still, more or less ... Kill myself! Faith, no,' he said to himself after a few days, 'Napoleon lived... 'Besides, life is pleasant to me; this is a quiet spot to stay in; I have no worries,' he added, laughing, and set to work to make a list of the books which he wished to have sent to him from Paris.

Chapter A Dungeon The tomb of a friend. STERNE He heard a great din in the corridor; it was not the hour for visiting his cell; the osprey flew away screaming, the door opened, and the vener- able cure Chelan, trembling all over and leaning upon his cane, flung himself into Julien's arms. 'Ah, great God! Is it possible, my child ... Monster, I ought to say.' And the good old man could not add another word. Julien was afraid of his falling. He was obliged to lead him to a chair. The hand of time had fallen heavily upon this man, so vigorous in days gone by. He ap- peared to Julien to be only the ghost of his former self. When he had recovered his breath: 'Only the day before yesterday, I received your letter from Strasbourg, with your five hundred francs for the poor of Verrieres; it was brought to me up in the mountains at Liveru, where I have gone to live with my nephew Jean. Yesterday, I learned of the catastrophe ... Oh, heavens! Is it possible?' The old man's tears ceased to flow, he seemed incapable of thought and added mechan- ically: 'You will need your five hundred francs, I have brought them back to you.' 'I need to see you, Father!' Julien exclaimed with emotion. 'I have plenty of money.' But he could not extract any coherent answer. From time to time, M. Chelan shed a few tears which rolled in silence down his cheeks; then he gazed at Julien, and was almost stupefied at seeing him take his hands and raise them to his lips. That countenance, once so lively, and so vigor- ous in its expression of the noblest sentiments, was no longer to be aroused from a state of apathy. A sort of peasant came presently to fetch the old man. 'It does not do to tire him,' he said to Julien, who realised that this was the nephew. This visit left Julien plunged in bitter grief

which stopped his tears. Everything seemed to him sad and comfortless; he felt his heart freeze in his bosom. This was the most cruel moment that he had experienced since the crime. He had seen death face to face, and in all its ugliness. All the illu- sions of greatness of soul and generosity had been scattered like a cloud before the storm. This fearful situation lasted for some hours. After moral poisoning, one requires physical remedies and a bottle of champagne. Julien would have deemed himself a coward had he had recourse to them. Towards the end of a horrible day, the whole of which he had spent in pacing the floor of his narrow dungeon: 'What a fool I am!' he exclaimed. 'It would be if I expected to die in my bed that the sight of that poor old man ought to make me so utterly wretched; but a swift death in the springtide of life is the very thing to save me from that miserable decrepitude.' Whatever arguments he might thus advance, Julien found that he was moved like any pusillanimous creature and made wretched in con- sequence by this visit. There was no longer any trace of rugged grandeur in him, any Roman virtue; death appeared to him on a higher plane, and as a thing less eas- ily to be won. 'This shall be my thermometer,' he said to himself. This evening I am ten degrees below the level of courage that must lead me to the guillot- ine. This morning, I had that courage. What does it matter, after all? Provided that it returns to me at the right moment.' This idea of a ther- mometer amused him and succeeded finally in distracting him. Next morning, on waking, he was ashamed of his behaviour the day before. 'My happiness, my tranquillity are at stake.' He almost made up his mind to write to the Attorney-General to ask that nobody should be admitted to his cell. 'And Fouque?' he thought. 'If he can manage to come to Besancon, how distressed he will be.' It was perhaps two months since he had given Fouque a thought. 'I was an utter fool at Strasbourg, my thoughts never went beyond my coat collar.' Memories of Fouque kept recurring to his mind and left him in a more tender mood. He paced the floor with agitation. 'Now I am cer- tainly twenty degrees below the level of death ... If this weakness in- creases, it will pay me better to kill myself. What a joy for the abbe Maslons and the Valenods if I die here like a rat!' Fouque arrived; the simple, honest fellow was shattered by grief. His sole idea, if he had one at all, was to sell all that he possessed in order to

corrupt the gaoler and so save Julien's life. He spoke to him for hours of the escape of M. de Lavalette. 'You distress me,' Julien said to him; 'M. de Lavalette was innocent, I am guilty. Without meaning to do so, you make me realise the difference ... 'But is it true? What! You would sell all that you have?' said Julien, suddenly becoming observant and suspicious once more. Fouque, delighted to see his friend at last responsive to his dominant idea, explained to him in full detail, and to within a hundred francs or so, what he expected to receive for each of his properties. 'What a sublime effort in a small landowner!' thought Julien. 'How many savings, how many little cheese-parings, which made me blush so when I saw him make them, he is willing to sacrifice for me! None of those fine young fellows whom I used to see at the Hotel de La Mole, who read Rene, would have any of his absurdities; but apart from those of them who are very young and have inherited fortunes, as well, and know nothing of the value of money, which of those fine Parisians would be capable of such a sacrifice?' All Fouque's mistakes in grammer, all his vulgar mannerisms van- ished, he flung himself into his arms. Never have the provinces, when contrasted with Paris, received a nobler homage. Fouque, delighted by the enthusiasm which he read in his friend's eyes, mistook it for consent to an escape. This glimpse of the sublime restored to Julien all the strength of which M. Chelan's visit had robbed him. He was still very young; but, to my mind, he was a fine plant. Instead of his advancing from tenderness to cunning, like the majority of men, age would have given him an easy ac- cess to emotion, he would have been cured of an insane distrust ... But what good is there in these vain predictions? The examinations became more frequent, in spite of the efforts of Juli- en, whose answers were all aimed at cutting the whole business short. 'I have taken life, or at least I have sought to take life, and with premedita- tion,' he repeated day after day. But the magistrate was a formalist first and foremost. Julien's statements in no way cut short the examinations; the magistrate's feelings were hurt. Julien did not know that they had proposed to remove him to a horrible cellar, and that it was thanks to Fouque's intervention that he was allowed to remain in his charming room one hundred and eighty steps from the ground. M. l'abbe de Frilair was one of the important persons who contracted with Fouque for the supply of their firewood. The honest merchant had

access even to the all-powerful Vicar-General. To his inexpressible de- light, M. de Frilair informed him that, touched by the good qualities of Julien and by the services which he had rendered in the past to the Sem- inary, he intended to intervene on his behalf with the judges. Fouque saw a hope of saving his friend, and on leaving his presence, bowing to the ground, begged the Vicar-General to expend upon masses, to pray for the acquittal of the prisoner, a sum of ten louis. Fouque was strangely in error. M. de Frilair was by no means a Valen- od. He refused, and even tried to make the worthy peasant understand that he would do better to keep his money in his pocket. Seeing that it was impossible to make his meaning clear without indiscretion, he ad- vised him to distribute the sum in alms, for the poor prisoners, who, as a matter of fact, were in need of everything. 'This Julien is a strange creature, his action is inexplicable,' thought M. de Frilair, 'and nothing ought to be inexplicable to me ... Perhaps it will be possible to make a martyr of him ... In any case, I shall get to the true inwardness of this business and may perhaps find an opportunity of in- spiring fear in that Madame de Renal, who has no respect for us, and de- tests me in her heart... Perhaps I may even discover in all this some sen- sational means of reconciliation with M. de La Mole, who has a weak- ness for this little Seminarist.' The settlement of the lawsuit had been signed some weeks earlier, and the abbe Pirard had left Besancon, not without having spoken of the mystery of Julien's birth, on the very day on which the wretched fellow tried to kill Madame de Renal in the church of Verrieres. Julien saw only one disagreeable incident in store for him before his death, namely a visit from his father. He consulted Fouque as to his idea of writing to the Attorney-General, asking to be excused any further vis- itors. This horror at the sight of a father, at such a moment, shocked the honest and respectable heart of the timber-merchant profoundly. He thought he understood why so many people felt a passionate hatred of his friend. Out of respect for another's grief, he concealed his feelings. 'In any case,' he replied coldly, 'an order for solitary confinement would not apply to your father.'

Chapter A Man of Power But there is such mystery in her movements, such elegance in her form. Who can she be? SCHILLER The doors of the dungeon were thrown open at a very early hour the next morning. Julien awoke with a start. 'Oh, good God,' he thought, 'here comes my father. What a disagree- able scene!' At that moment, a woman dressed as a peasant flung herself into his arms; he had difficulty in recognising her. It was Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'Miscreant, it was only from your letter that I learned where you were. What you call your crime, though it is nothing but a noble revenge which shows me all the loftiness of the heart that beats in your bosom, I learned only at Verrieres ... ' Notwithstanding his prejudices against Mademoiselle de La Mole, pre- judices of which, moreover, he had not himself formed any definite idea, Julien found her extremely good-looking. How could he fail to see in all this manner of speech and action a noble, disinterested sentiment, far above anything that a petty, vulgar spirit would have dared? He ima- gined once again that he was in love with a queen, and after a few mo- ments it was with a rare nobility of speech and thought that he said to her: 'The future was tracing itself quite clearly before my eyes. After my death, I married you to Croisenois, who would be marrying a widow. The noble but slightly romantic spirit of this charming widow, startled and converted to the service of common prudence by an event at once singular, tragic and for her momentous, would have deigned to appreci- ate the quite genuine merit of the young Marquis. You would have resigned yourself to enjoying the happiness of the rest of the world: es- teem, riches, high rank ... But, dear Mathilde, your coming to Besancon,

if it is suspected, is going to be a mortal blow to M. de La Mole, and that is what I will never forgive myself. I have already caused him so much sorrow! The Academician will say that he has been warming a serpent in his bosom.' 'I must confess that I hardly expected so much cold reasoning, so much thought for the future,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, half an- noyed. 'My maid, who is almost as prudent as yourself, procured a pass- port for herself, and it is in the name of Madame Michelet that I have travelled post.' 'And Madame Michelet found it so easy to make her way in to me?' 'Ah! You are still the superior man, the man of my choice! First of all, I offered a hundred francs to a magistrate's secretary, who assured me that it was impossible for me to enter this dungeon. But after taking the money, this honest man made me wait, raised objections, I thought that he meant to rob me ... ' She broke off. 'Well?' asked Julien. 'Do not be angry with me, my little Julien,' she said, embracing him, 'I was obliged to give my name to this secretary, who took me for a young milliner from Paris, enamoured of the handsome Julien ... Indeed, those are his very words. I swore to him that I was your wife, and I am to have permission to see you every day.' 'That finishes everything,' thought Julien; 'I could not prevent it. After all, M. de La Mole is so great a nobleman that public opinion will easily find an excuse for the young Colonel who will wed this charming wid- ow. My approaching death will cover everything'; and he abandoned himself with ecstasy to Mathilde's love; there followed madness, mag- nanimity, everything that was most strange. She seriously proposed to him that she should die with him. After these first transports, and when she had grown used to the hap- piness of seeing Julien, a keen curiosity suddenly took possession of her soul. She examined her lover, and found him far superior to what she had imagined. Boniface de La Mole seemed to her reincarnate in him, but in a more heroic mould. Mathilde saw the leading counsel of the place, whom she insulted by offering them gold too crudely; but they ended by accepting. She speedily came to the conclusion that in doubtful matters of high import, everything in Besancon depended upon M. l'abbe de Frilair. Under the obscure name of Madame Michelet, she at first found insu- perable obstacles in the way to the presence of the all-powerful leader of the Congregation. But the rumour of the beauty of a young milliner,

madly in love, who had come from Paris to Besancon to comfort the young abbe Julien Sorel, began to spread through the town. Mathilde went alone and on foot through the streets of Besancon; she hoped that she might not be recognised. In any event, she thought that it must help her cause to create a strong impression upon the populace. In her folly she thought of making them revolt, to save Julien on his way to the scaffold. Mademoiselle de La Mole imagined herself to be dressed simply and in a manner becoming a woman stricken with grief; she was dressed in such a fashion as to attract every eye. She was the sole object of attention in Besancon, when, after a week of solicitation, she obtained an audience of M. Frilair. Great as her courage might be, the idea of an influential head of the Congregation and that of a profound and cautious rascality were so closely associated in her mind that she trembled as she rang the bell at the door of the Bishop's palace. She could barely stand when she had to climb the stair that led to the First Vicar-General's apartment. The loneli- ness of the episcopal palace chilled her with fear. 'I may sit down in an armchair, and the armchair grip me by the arms, I shall have vanished. Of whom can my maid ask for news of me? The Captain of Police will decline to interfere ... I am all alone in this great town!' Her first sight of the apartment set Mademoiselle de La Mole's heart at rest. First of all, it was a footman in the most elegant livery that had opened the door to her. The parlour in which she was asked to wait dis- played that refined and delicate luxury, so different from vulgar magni- ficence, which one finds in Paris only in the best houses. As soon as she caught sight of M. de Frilair, who came towards her with a fatherly air, all thoughts of a dastardly crime vanished. She did not even find on his handsome countenance the imprint of that energetic, that almost wild virtue, so antipathetic to Parisian society. The half-smile that animated the features of the priest who was in supreme control of everything at Besancon, betokened the man used to good society, the cultured prelate, the able administrator. Mathilde imagined herself in Paris. It needed only a few minutes for M. de Frilair to lead Mathilde on to admit to him that she was the daughter of his powerful adversary, the Marquis de La Mole. 'I am not, as a matter of fact, Madame Michelet,' she said, resuming all the loftiness of her bearing, 'and this admission costs me little, for I have come to consult you, Sir, as to the possibility of procuring the escape of M. de La Vernaye. In the first place he is guilty of nothing worse than a piece of stupidity; the woman at whom he fired is doing well. In the

second place, to corrupt the subordinates, I can put down here and now fifty thousand francs, and bind myself to pay double that sum. Lastly, my gratitude and the gratitude of my family will consider no request im- possible from the person who has saved M. de La Vernaye.' M. de Frilair appeared to be surprised at this name. Mathilde showed him a number of letters from the Ministry of War, addressed to M. Julien Sorel de La Vernaye. 'You see, Sir, that my father undertook to provide for his future. I mar- ried him secretly, my father wished him to be a senior officer before making public this marriage, which is a little odd for a La Mole.' Mathilde remarked that the expression of benevolence and of a mild gaiety speedily vanished as M. de Frilair began to arrive at important discoveries. A subtlety blended with profound insincerity was portrayed on his features. The abbe had his doubts, he perused the official documents once more slowly. 'What advantage can I gain from these strange confidences?' he asked himself. 'Here I am suddenly brought into close personal contact with a friend of the famous Marechale de Fervaques, the all-powerful niece of the Lord Bishop of ——, through whom one becomes a Bishop in France. 'What I have always regarded as hidden in the future suddenly presents itself. This may lead me to the goal of all my ambition.' At first Mathilde was alarmed by the rapid change in the physiognomy of this powerful man, with whom she found herself shut up alone in a remote part of the building. 'But why!' she said to herself presently, 'would it not have been worse to have made no impression upon the cold egoism of a priest sated with the enjoyment of power?' Dazzled by this rapid and unexpected avenue to the episcopate that was opening before his eyes, astonished at Mathilde's intelligence, for a moment M. de Frilair was off his guard. Mademoiselle de La Mole saw him almost at her feet, trembling nervously with the intensity of his ambition. 'Everything becomes clear,' she thought, 'nothing will be impossible here for a friend of Madame de Fervaques.' Despite a sense of jealousy that was still most painful, she found courage to explain that Julien was an intimate friend of the Marechale, and almost every evening used to meet, in her house, the Lord Bishop of ——. 'If you were to draw by lot four or five times in succession a list of thirty-six jurymen from among the principal inhabitants of this Depart- ment,' said the Vicar-General with the harsh glare of ambition, dwelling

upon each of his words, 'I should consider myself most unfortunate if in each list I did not find eight or nine friends, and those the most intelli- gent of the lot. Almost invariably I should have a majority, more than that, even for a verdict of guilty; you see, Mademoiselle, with what ease I can secure an acquittal ... " The abbe broke off suddenly, as though startled by the sound of his words; he was admitting things which are never uttered to the profane. But Mathilde in turn was stupefied when he informed her that what was most astonishing and interesting to Besancon society in Julien's strange adventure, was that in the past he had inspired a grand passion in Madame de Renal, which he had long reciprocated. M. de Frilair had no difficulty in perceiving the extreme distress which his story produced. 'I have my revenge!' he thought. 'Here, at last, is a way of controlling this decided young person; I was trembling lest I should not succeed in finding one.' Her distinguished air, as of one not easily led, intensified in his eyes the charm of the rare beauty which he saw almost suppliant be- fore him. He recovered all his self-possession and had no hesitation in turning the knife in the wound. 'I should not be surprised after all,' he said to her lightly, 'were we to learn that it was from jealousy that M. Sorel fired two shots at this wo- man whom once he loved so dearly. She must have had some relaxation, and for some time past she had been seeing a great deal of a certain abbe Marquinot of Dijon, a sort of Jansenist, utterly without morals, like all of them.' M. de Frilair went on torturing with voluptuous relish and at his leis- ure the heart of this beautiful girl, whose weak spot he had discovered. 'Why,' he said, fixing a pair of burning eyes on Mathilde, 'should M. Sorel have chosen the church, if not because at that very moment his rival was celebrating mass there? Everyone agrees in ascribing boundless intelligence and even more prudence to the man who is so fortunate as to enjoy your protection. What more simple than to conceal himself in M. de Renal's gardens, which he knows so well? There, with almost a cer- tainty of not being seen, nor caught, nor suspected, he could have inflic- ted death on the woman of whom he was jealous.' These arguments, apparently so well founded, reduced Mathilde to ut- ter despair. Her spirit, haughty enough but saturated with all that dry prudence which passes in society as a faithful portrayal of the human heart, was not made to understand in a moment the joy of defying all prudence which can be so keen a joy to an ardent soul. In the upper

classes of Parisian society, in which Mathilde had lived, passion can only very rarely divest itself of prudence, and it is from the attics on the fifth floor that girls throw themselves out of windows. At last the abbe de Frilair was sure of his control. He gave Mathilde to understand (he was probably lying) that he could influence as he chose the Crown Counsel, who would have to support the charge against Julien. After the names of the thirty-six jurors for the assize had been drawn by lot, he would make a direct and personal appeal to at least thirty of them. If M. de Frilair had not thought Mathilde so good-looking, he would not have spoken to her in such plain terms until their fifth or sixth interview.

Chapter Intrigue Castres, 1676.—He that endeavoured to kill his sister in our house, had before killed a man, and it had cost his father five hundred ecus to get him off; by their secret distribution, gaining the favour of the counsellors. LOCKE, Travels in France 17 On leaving the Bishop's palace, Mathilde did not hesitate to send a messenger to Madame de Fervaques; the fear of compromising herself did not restrain her for a second. She implored her rival to obtain a letter for M. de Frilair, written throughout in the hand of the Lord Bishop of ——. She even went the length of beseeching the other to hasten, herself, to Besancon. This was a heroic measure on the part of a proud and jeal- ous spirit. On the advice of Fouque, she had taken the precaution of saying noth- ing about what she was doing to Julien. Her presence was disturbing enough in itself. A more honourable man at the approach of death than he had been during his life, he now felt compunction at the thought not only of M. de La Mole, but also of Mathilde. 'What is this?' he asked himself, 'I experience in her company moments of abstraction and even of boredom. She is ruining herself for me, and it is thus that I reward her. Can I indeed be wicked?' This question would have troubled him little when he was ambitious; then, not to succeed in life was the only disgrace in his eyes. His moral uneasiness, in Mathilde's presence, was all the more marked, in that he inspired in her at that moment the most extraordinary and insensate passion. She could speak of nothing but the strange sacri- fices which she was anxious to make to save him. 17.I am indebted to the patience and ingenuity of Mr. Vyvyan Holland, who has traced the original text of this motto in The Life of John Locke, with extracts from his Correspond- ence, Journals and Commonplace Books by Lord King (new edition, 1830) C.

Carried away by a sentiment of which she was proud and which com- pletely overbore her pride, she would have liked not to allow a moment of her life to pass that was not filled with some extraordinary action. The strangest plans, the most perilous to herself, formed the theme of her long conversations with Julien. His gaolers, well rewarded, allowed her to have her way in the prison. Mathilde's ideas were not confined to the sacrifice of her reputation; it mattered nothing to her though she made her condition known to the whole of society. To fling herself on her knees to crave pardon for Julien, in front of the King's carriage as it came by at a gallop, to attract the royal attention, at the risk of a thousand deaths, was one of the tamest fancies of this exalted and courageous ima- gination. Through her friends who held posts at court, she could count upon being admitted to the reserved parts of the park of Saint-Cloud. Julien felt himself to be hardly worthy of such devotion, to tell the truth he was tired of heroism. It would have required a simple, artless, almost timid affection to appeal to him, whereas on the contrary, Mathilde's proud spirit must always entertain the idea of a public, of what people would say. In the midst of all her anguish, of all her fears for the life of this lover, whom she was determined not to outlive, she had a secret longing to as- tonish the public by the intensity of her love and the sublimity of her actions. He resented the discovery that he was unable to feel at all touched by all this heroism. What would his resentment have been, had he known of all the follies with which Mathilde overpowered the devoted, but emin- ently reasonable and limited mind of the good Fouque? The latter could scarcely find fault with Mathilde's devotion; for he, too, would have sacrificed his whole fortune and exposed his life to the greatest risks to save Julien. He was stupefied by the quantity of gold which Mathilde scattered abroad. At first, the sums thus spent impressed Fouque, who had for money all the veneration of a provincial. Later, he discovered that Mademoiselle de La Mole's plans often var- ied, and, to his great relief, found a word with which to reproach this character which was so exhausting to him: she was changeable. To this epithet, that of wrongheaded, the direst anathema in the provinces, is the immediate sequel. 'It is strange,' Julien said to himself one day as Mathilde was leaving his prison, 'that so warm a passion, and one of which I am the object, leaves me so unmoved! And I worshipped her two months ago! I have indeed read that at the approach of death we lose interest in everything;

but it is frightful to feel oneself ungrateful and to be unable to change. Can I be an egoist?' He heaped on himself, in this connection, the most humiliating reproaches. Ambition was dead in his heart, another passion had risen from its ashes; he called it remorse for having murdered Madame de Renal. As a matter of fact, he was hopelessly in love with her. He found a strange happiness when, left absolutely alone and without any fear of being disturbed, he could abandon himself entirely to the memory of the happy days which he had spent in the past at Verrieres or at Vergy. The most trifling incidents of that time, too swiftly flown, had for him a freshness and a charm that were irresistible. He never gave a thought to his Parisian successes; they bored him. This tendency, which grew rapidly stronger, was not entirely hidden from the jealous Mathilde. She saw quite plainly that she had to contend with the love of solitude. Now and again, she uttered with terror in her heart the name of Madame de Renal. She saw Julien shudder. From that moment, her passion knew no bounds nor measure. 'If he dies, I die after him,' she said to herself with absolute sincerity. 'What would the drawing-rooms of Paris say, to see a girl of my rank carry to such a point her adoration of a lover condemned to death? To find such sentiments, we must go back to the days of the heroes; it was love of this nature that set hearts throbbing in the age of Charles IX and Henri III.' Amid the most impassioned transports, when she pressed Julien's head to her heart: 'What!' she said to herself with horror, 'can this pre- cious head be doomed to fall? Very well!' she added, inflamed by a hero- ism that was not devoid of happiness, 'my lips, which are now pressed against these dear locks, will be frozen within twenty-four hours after.' Memories of these moments of heroism and fearful ecstasy seized her in an ineluctable grip. The thought of suicide, so absorbing in itself, and hitherto so remote from that proud spirit, penetrated its defences and soon reigned there with an absolute sway. 'No, the blood of my ancestors has not grown lukewarm in its descent to me,' Mathilde told herself proudly. 'I have a favour to ask you,' her lover said to her one day: Put your child out to nurse at Verrieres, Madame de Renal will look after the nurse.' 'That is a very harsh saying ... ' Mathilde turned pale. 'True, and I ask a thousand pardons,' cried Julien, awakening from his dream and pressing her to his bosom.

Having dried her tears, he returned to the subject of his thoughts, but with more subtlety. He had given the conversation a turn of melancholy philosophy. He spoke of that future which was soon to close for him. 'You must agree, my dear friend, that the passions are an accident in life, but this accident is to be found only in superior beings ... The death of my son would be in reality a relief to the pride of your family, so much the subordinate agents will perceive. Neglect will be the lot of that child of misery and shame ... I hope that at a date which I do not wish to spe- cify, which however I have the courage to anticipate, you will obey my final behest: You will marry the Marquis de Croisenois.' 'What, dishonoured!' 'Dishonour can have no hold over such a name as yours. You will be a widow, and the widow of a madman, that is all. I shall go farther: my crime, being free from any pecuniary motive, will be in no way dishon- ouring. Perhaps by that time some philosophical legislator will have se- cured, from the prejudices of his contemporaries, the suppression of cap- ital punishment. Then, some friendly voice will cite as an instance: "Why, Mademoiselle de La Mole's first husband was mad, but not a wicked man, he was no criminal. It was absurd to cut his head off ... " Then my memory will cease to be infamous; at least, after a certain time ... Your position in society, your fortune, and, let me say, your genius will enable M. de Croisenois to play a part, once he is your husband, to which by himself he could not hope to attain. He has only his birth and his gallantry, and those qualities by them- selves, which made a man accomplished in 1729, are an anachronism a hundred years later, and only give rise to pretensions. A man must have other things besides if he is to place himself at the head of the youth of France. 'You will bring the support of a firm and adventurous character to the political party in which you will place your husband. You may succeed the Chevreuses and Longuevilles of the Fronde ... But by then, my dear friend, the heavenly fire which animates you at this moment will have cooled a little. 'Allow me to tell you,' he went on, after many other preliminary phrases, 'in fifteen years from now you will regard as an act of folly, par- donable but still an act of folly, the love that you have felt for me ... ' He broke off abruptly and returned to his dreams. He found himself once again confronted by that idea, so shocking to Mathilde: 'In fifteen years Madame de Renal will adore my son, and you will have forgotten him.'

Chapter Tranquillity It is because I was foolish then that I am now wise. O philosopher who see nothing save in a flash, how short is your vision! Your eye is not made to follow the underground working of the passions. FRAU VON GOETHE This conversation was interrupted by a judicial examination, followed by a conference with the lawyer retained for the defence. These were the only absolutely disagreeable moments in a heedless existence full of tender fantasies. 'It was murder, and premeditated murder,' said Julien to magistrate and counsel alike. 'I am sorry, gentlemen,' he added, smiling; 'but this re- duces your task to a very small matter. 'After all,' thought Julien, when he had succeeded in ridding himself of these two persons, 'I must be brave, and braver, evidently, than these two men. They regard as the worst of evils, as the king of terrors, this duel to a fatal issue, of which I shall begin to think seriously only upon the day itself. 'That is because I have known a greater evil,' Julien continued, philo- sophising to himself. 'I suffered far more keenly on my first journey to Strasbourg, when I thought that I had been abandoned by Mathilde ... And to think that I longed with such passion for this perfect intimacy which today leaves me so unmoved! Indeed, I am happier by myself than when that lovely girl shares my solitude ... ' The lawyer, a man of rules and formalities, thought him mad, and sup- posed, with the rest of the public, that it was jealousy that had put the pistol in his hand. One day, he ventured to suggest to Julien that this al- legation, whether true or false, would be an excellent line of defence. But the prisoner became in a flash passionate and incisive.

'On your life, Sir,' cried Julien beside himself with rage, 'bear in mind never again to utter that abominable falsehood.' The prudent advocate was afraid for a moment of being murdered himself. He prepared his defence, because the decisive moment was rapidly approaching. Besancon and the whole Department could talk of nothing but this cause celebre. Julien was in ignorance of this, he had begged that no one should ever speak to him of such matters. That very day, Fouque and Mathilde having sought to inform him of certain public rumours, which seemed to them to furnish grounds for hope, Julien had cut them short at the first word. 'Leave me to enjoy my ideal life. Your petty bickerings, your details of real life, all more or less irritating to me, would bring me down from heaven. One dies as best one can; as for me, I wish to think of death only in my own way. What do I care for other people? My relations with other people are soon to be cut short. For pity's sake, do not speak to me of them again: it is quite enough to have to see the magistrate and my counsel. 'Indeed,' he said to himself, 'it appears to be my destiny to die in a dream. An obscure creature, like myself, sure of being forgotten within a fortnight, would indeed be foolish, one must admit, were he to play a part ... 'It is strange, all the same, that I have learned the art of enjoying life only now that I see its term draw so near.' He spent these last days in pacing the narrow terrace on the roof of his dungeon, smoking some excellent cigars for which Mathilde had sent a courier to Holland, and with no suspicion that his appearance was daily awaited by all the telescopes in the town. His thoughts were at Vergy. Never did he speak of Madame de Renal to Fouque, but on two or three occasions this friend told him that she was recovering rapidly, and these words echoed in his heart. While Julien's spirit was almost always completely lost in the world of ideas, Mathilde, occupied with realities, as becomes an aristocratic heart, had contrived to increase the intimacy of the direct correspondence between Madame de Fervaques and M. de Frilair to such a point that already the mighty word Bishopric had been uttered. The venerable prelate, in whose hands was the list of benefices, added as a postscript to one of his niece's letters: 'That poor Sorel is nothing worse than a fool, I hope that he will be restored to us.' At the sight of these lines, M. de Frilair was almost out of his mind. He had no doubt of his ability to save Julien.

'But for that Jacobinical law which prescribes the registration of an endless list of jurors, and has no other real object than to take away all influence from well-born people,' he said to Mathilde, on the eve of the drawing by lot of the thirty-six jurors for the assize, 'I could have answered for the verdict. Did I not secure the acquittal of the cure N—— ?' It was with pleasure that, on the following day, among the names drawn from the urn, M. de Frilair found those of five members of the Congregation of Besancon, and, among those who were strangers to the town, the names of MM. Valenod, de Moirod and de Cholin. 'I can an- swer at once for these eight jurors,' he told Mathilde. 'The first five are machines. Valenod is my agent, Moirod owes all he has to me, Cholin is an imbecile, who is afraid of everything.' The newspaper published throughout the Department the names of the jurors, and Madame de Renal, to the inexpressible terror of her hus- band, decided to come to Besancon. All that M. de Renal could obtain from her was that she would not leave her bed, so that she might not be exposed to the nuisance of being summoned to give evidence. 'You do not understand my position,' said the former Mayor of Verrieres. 'I am now a Liberal of the defection, as they call it; no doubt but that rascal Valenod and M. de Frilair will easily persuade the Attorney General and the Judges to anything that can be unpleasant for me.' Madame de Renal yielded without protest to her husband's orders, 'ïf I were to appear at the Assize Court,' she told herself, 'I should seem to be demanding vengeance.' Notwithstanding all the promises of prudence made to her spiritual director and to her husband, no sooner had she arrived in Besancon than she wrote with her own hand to each of the thirty-six jurors: 'I shall not appear in Court upon the day of the trial, Sir, because my presence might prejudice M. Sorel's case. I desire but one thing in the world, and that passionately, namely his acquittal. Be assured of this, the terrible thought that on my account an innocent man has been sent to his death would poison the remainder of my life, and would doubtless shorten it. How could you sentence him to death, while I still live? No, beyond question, society has not the right to take life, especially from such a man as Julien Sorel. Everyone at Verrieres has seen him in mo- ments of distraction. This poor young man has powerful enemies; but, even among his enemies (and how many they are!) who is there that has any doubt of his admirable talents and his profound learning? It is not an ordinary person that you are about to judge, Sir. For nearly eighteen

months we have all known him to be pious, wise, studious; but, two or three times in the year, he was seized by fits of melancholy which bordered on insanity. The whole town of Verrieres, all our neighbours at Vergy where we go in the fine weather, all my family, the Sub-Prefect himself, will bear testimony to his exemplary piety; he knows by heart the whole of the Holy Bible. Would an unbeliever have applied himself for years on end to learning the Holy Scriptures? My sons will have the honour to present this letter to you: they are children. Deign to question them, Sir, they will furnish you with all the details relative to this poor young man that may still be necessary to convince you of the barbarity of condemning him. Far from avenging me, you would be sentencing me to death. 'What is there that his enemies can advance in rebuttal of the following fact? The injury that ensued from one of those moments of insanity which my children themselves used to remark in their tutor was so far from dangerous that within less than two months, it has allowed me to post from Verrieres to Besancon. If I learn, Sir, that you have even the slightest hesitation in saving from the barbarity of our laws a person who is so little guilty, I shall leave my bed, to which I am confined solely by my husband's orders, and shall come to throw myself at your feet. 'Declare, Sir, that the premeditation is not proven, and you will not have to reproach yourself with the blood of an innocent man,' etc., etc.

Chapter The Trial The country will remember this celebrated trial for a long time to come. Interest in the accused reached fever pitch; this was be- cause his crime was astonishing and yet not atrocious. Even if it had been, the young man was so handsome! His great destiny ab- ruptly cut short heightened the pity felt for him. Will he be con- demned? the women would ask the men of their acquaintance and one could see them grow pale as they awaited the reply. SAINTE-BEUVE At length the day dawned so dreaded by Madame de Renal and Mathilde. The strange appearance of the town increased their terror, and did not leave even Fouque's stout heart unmoved. The whole Province had swarmed into Besancon to witness the trial of this romantic case. For some days past there had not been a bed to be had in the inns. The President of the Assize Court was assailed with requests for cards of ad- mission; all the ladies of the town wished to be present at the trial; Julien's portrait was hawked through the streets, etc., etc. Mathilde was keeping in reserve for this supreme moment a letter written throughout in the hand of the Lord Bishop of ——. This Prelate, who controlled the Church in France and appointed Bishops, deigned to ask for the acquittal of Julien. On the eve of the trial, Mathilde took this letter to the all-powerful Vicar-General. At the close of the interview, as she was leaving the room in a flood of tears: 'I answer for the verdict of the jury,' M. de Frilair told her, emer- ging at length from his diplomatic reserve, and almost showing signs of emotion himself. 'Among the twelve persons charged with the duty of finding whether your protege's crime is proven, and especially whether there was premeditation, I number six friends devoted to my welfare, and I have given them to understand that it rested with them to raise me to the episcopate. Baron de Valenod, whom I have made Mayor of

Verrieres, has entire control over two of his subordinates, MM. de Moirod and de Cholin. To tell the truth, chance has given us, for dealing with this affair, two jurors who are extremely disaffected; but, although Ultra-Liberals, they loyally obey my orders on great occasions, and I have sent word asking them to vote with M. Valenod. I learn that a sixth juror of the industrial class, an immensely rich and garrulous Liberal, is secretly hoping for a contract from the Ministry of War, and no doubt he would not wish to vex me. I have let him know that M. Valenod has my last word.' 'And who is this M. Valenod?' said Mathilde, anxiously. 'If you knew him, you would have no doubt of our success. He is a bold speaker, impudent, coarse, a man made to be the leader of fools. 1814 raised him from penury, and I am going to make him a Prefect. He is capable of thrashing the other jurors if they refuse to vote as he wishes.' Mathilde was somewhat reassured. There was another discussion in store for her that evening. In order not to prolong a painful scene, the outcome of which appeared to him certain, Julien was determined not to open his mouth. 'My counsel will speak, that is quite sufficient,' he said to Mathilde. 'As it is, I shall be all too long exposed as a spectacle to my enemies. These provincials are shocked by the rapid advancement which I owe to you, and, believe me, there is not one of them that does not wish for my con- viction, except that he will cry like a fool when I am led to the scaffold.' 'They wish to see you humiliated, it is only too true,' replied Mathilde, 'but I do not believe that they are cruel. My presence in Besancon and the spectacle of my grief have interested all the women; your handsome face will do the rest. If you say but one word before your judges, the whole court will be on your side,' etc., etc. The following morning at nine o'clock, when Julien came down from his prison to enter the great hall of the Law Courts, it was with the ut- most difficulty that the gendarmes succeeded in clearing a passage through the immense crowd that packed the courtyard. Julien had slept well, he was quite calm, and felt no other sentiment than one of philo- sophical piety towards this crowd of envious persons who, without cruelty, were ready to applaud his sentence of death. He was quite sur- prised when, having been detained for more than a quarter of an hour among the crowd, he was obliged to admit that his presence was inspir- ing a tender pity in the assembly. He did not hear a single unpleasant

remark. 'These provincials are less evil-minded than I supposed,' he said to himself. On entering the court, he was struck by the elegance of the architec- ture. It was pure gothic, with a number of charming little pillars carved in stone with the most perfect finish. He imagined himself in England. But presently his whole attention was absorbed in twelve or fifteen pretty women who, seated opposite the dock, filled the three galleries above the bench and the jurybox. On turning round towards the public seats, he saw that the circular gallery which overhung the well of the court was filled with women; most of them were young and seemed to him extremely pretty; their eyes were bright and full of interest. In the rest of the court, the crowd was enormous; people were struggling at the doors, and the sentries were unable to preserve silence. When all the eyes that were looking for Julien became aware of his presence, on seeing him take his place on the slightly raised bench re- served for the prisoner, he was greeted with a murmur of astonishment and tender interest. One would have said that morning that he was not yet twenty; he was dressed quite simply, but with a perfect grace; his hair and brow were charming; Mathilde had insisted on presiding in person over his toilet. His pallor was intense. As soon as he had taken his seat on the bench, he heard people say on all sides: 'Lord, how young he is! ... ' 'But he is a boy.' 'He is far better looking than his portrait.' 'Prisoner,' said the gendarme seated on his right, 'do you see those six ladies who are on that balcony?' The gendarme pointed to a little gallery which jutted out above the amphitheatre in which the jury was placed. 'That is the Prefect's lady,' the gendarme continued; 'next to her, Madame la Marquise de M —— ; that one loves you dearly. I heard her speak to the examining magistrate. Next to her is Madame Derville.' 'Madame Derville,' exclaimed Julien, and a vivid blush suffused his brow. 'When she leaves the court,' he thought, 'she will write to Madame de Renal.' He knew nothing of Madame de Renal's arrival at Besancon. The witnesses were quickly heard. At the first words of the speech for the prosecution made by the counsel for the prosecution, two of the ladies seated on the little balcony burst into tears. 'Madame Derville is not so easily moved,' thought Julien. He noticed, however, that she was extremely flushed. The counsel for the prosecution was labouring an emotional point in bad French about the barbarity of the crime that had been committed; Julien noticed that Madame Derville's neighbours showed signs of

strong disapproval. Several of the jury, evidently friends of these ladies, spoke to them and seemed to reassure them. 'That can only be a good sign,' thought Julien. Until then he had felt himself penetrated by an unmixed contempt for all the men who were taking part in this trial. The insipid eloquence of the counsel for the prosecution increased this sense of disgust. But gradually the sereneness of Julien's heart melted before the marks of in- terest of which he was plainly the object. He was pleased with the firm expression of his counsel. 'No fine lan- guage,' he murmured to him as he stood up to speak. 'All the emphasis stolen from Bossuet, which has been displayed against you, has helped your case,' said the counsel. And indeed, he had not been speaking for five minutes before almost all the ladies had their handkerchiefs in their hands. The counsel, encouraged by this, ad- dressed the jury in extremely strong language. Julien shuddered, he felt that he was on the point of bursting into tears. 'Great God! What will my enemies say?' He was about to yield to the emotion that was overpowering him, when, fortunately for himself, he caught an insolent glance from M. Valenod. 'That wretch's eyes are ablaze,' he said to himself; 'what a triumph for that vile nature! Had my crime led to this alone, I should be bound to ab- hor it. Heaven knows what he will say of me to Madame de Renal!' This thought obliterated all the rest. Shortly afterwards, Julien was re- called to himself by sounds of approval from the public. His counsel had just concluded his speech. Julien remembered that it was the correct thing to shake hands with him. The time had passed quickly. Refreshments were brought to counsel and prisoner. It was only then that Julien was struck by a curious circumstance: none of the women had left the court for dinner. 'Faith, I am dying of hunger,' said his counsel, 'and you?' 'I am also,' replied Julien. 'Look, there is the Prefect's lady getting her dinner, too,' his counsel said to him, pointing to the little balcony. 'Cheer up, everything is going well.' The trial was resumed. As the President was summing up, midnight struck. He was obliged to pause; amid the silence of the universal anxiety, the echoing notes of the clock filled the court. 'Here begins the last day of my life,' thought Julien. Presently he felt himself inflamed by the idea of duty. He had kept his emotion in check

until then, and maintained his determination not to speak; but when the President of the Assizes asked him if he had anything to say, he rose. He saw in front of him the eyes of Madame Derville, which, in the lamp- light, seemed to shine with a strange brilliance. 'Can she be crying, by any chance,' he wondered. 'Gentlemen of the Jury, 'My horror of the contempt which I believed that I could endure at the moment of my death, impels me to speak. Gentlemen, I have not the honour to belong to your class, you see in me a peasant who has risen in revolt against the lowliness of his station. 'I ask you for no mercy,' Julien went on, his voice growing stronger. 'I am under no illusion; death is in store for me; it will be a just punish- ment. I have been guilty of attempting the life of the woman most worthy of all respect, of all devotion. Madame de Renal had been like a mother to me. My crime is atrocious, and it was premeditated. I have, therefore, deserved death, Gentlemen of the Jury. But, even were I less guilty, I see before me men who, without pausing to consider what pity may be due to my youth, will seek to punish in me and to discourage forever that class of young men who, born in an inferior station and in a sense burdened with poverty, have the good fortune to secure a sound education, and the audacity to mingle with what the pride of rich people calls society. 'That is my crime, Gentlemen, and it will be punished with all the more severity inasmuch as actually I am not being tried by my peers. I do not see, anywhere among the jury, a peasant who has grown rich, but only indignant bourgeois ... ' For twenty minutes Julien continued to speak in this strain; he said everything that was in his heart; the counsel for the prosecution, who as- pired to the favour of the aristocracy, kept springing from his seat; but in spite of the somewhat abstract turn which Julien had given the debate, all the women were dissolved in tears. Madame Derville herself had her handkerchief pressed to her eyes. Before concluding, Julien returned to the question of premeditation, to his repentance, to the respect, the filial and unbounded adoration which, in happier times, he had felt for Ma- dame de Renal ... Madame Derville uttered a cry and fainted. One o'clock struck as the jury retired to their waiting-room. None of the women had left their seats; several of the men had tears in their eyes. The general conversation was at first most lively; but gradually, as the jury delayed their verdict, the feeling of weariness spread a calm over the assembly. It was a solemn moment; the lamps burned more dimly.

Julien, who was dead tired, heard them discussing round him whether this delay augured well or ill. He noticed with pleasure that everyone was on his side; the jury did not return, and still not a woman left the court. Just as two o'clock had struck, a general stir was audible. The little door of the jury-room opened. M. le Baron de Valenod advanced with a grave, theatrical step, followed by the rest of the jury. He coughed, then declared that on his soul and conscience the unanimous opinion of the jury was that Julien Sorel was guilty of murder, and of murder with pre- meditation: this verdict inferred a sentence of death; it was pronounced a moment later. Julien looked at his watch, and remembered M. de La- valette; it was a quarter past two. Today is Friday,' he thought. 'Yes, but this is a lucky day for Valenod, who is sentencing me ... I am too closely guarded for Mathilde to be able to effect my escape, like Ma- dame de Lavalette ... And so, in three days, at this same hour, I shall know what to think of the great hereafter.' At that moment, he heard a cry and was recalled to the things of this world. The women round him were sobbing; he saw that every face was turned towards a little gallery concealed by the capital of a gothic pi- laster. He learned afterwards that Mathilde had been hidden there. As the cry was not repeated, everyone turned back to look at Julien, for whom the gendarmes were trying to clear a passage through the crowd. 'Let us try not to give that rascal Valenod any food for laughter,' thought Julien. 'With what a contrite and coaxing air he uttered the ver- dict that involved the death penalty! Whereas that poor president, even though he has been a judge for all these years, had tears in his eyes when he sentenced me. What a joy for Valenod to have his revenge for our old rivalry for Madame de Renal! And so I shall never see her any more! It is all finished ... A last farewell is impossible between us, I feel it ... How happy I should have been to express to her all the horror I feel for my crime! 'These words only: I feel that I am justly condemned.'

Chapter In the Prison When Julien was lee back to prison he had been put in a cell reserved for those under sentence of death. He, who, as a rule, observed the most tri- fling details, had never noticed that he was not being taken up to his old dungeon. He was thinking of what he would say to Madame de Renal, if, before the fatal moment, he should have the good fortune to see her. He felt that she would not allow him to speak, and was seeking a way of ex- pressing his repentance in the first words he would utter. 'After such an action, how am I to convince her that I love her and her only? For after all I sought to kill her either out of ambition or for love of Mathilde.' On getting into bed he found himself between sheets of a coarse cloth. The scales fell from his eyes. 'Ah! I am in the condemned cell,' he said to himself, 'awaiting my sentence. It is right ... 'Conte Altamira told me once that, on the eve of his death, Danton said in his loud voice: "It is strange, the verb to guillotine cannot be conjug- ated in all its tenses; one can say: I shall be guillotined, thou shalt be guil- lotined, but one does not say: I have been guillotined." 'Why not,' Julien went on, 'if there is another life? Faith, if I meet the Christian Deity, I am lost: He is a tyrant, and, as such, is full of ideas of vengeance; His Bible speaks of nothing but fearful punishments. I never loved Him! I could never even believe that anyone did love Him sin- cerely. He is devoid of pity.' (Here Julien recalled several passages from the Bible.) 'He will punish me in some abominable manner ... 'But if I meet the God of Fenelon! He will say to me perhaps: "Much shall be pardoned thee, because thou hast loved much ... " 'Have I loved much? Ah! I did love Madame de Renal, but my conduct has been atrocious. There, as elsewhere, I abandoned a simple and mod- est merit for what was brilliant ... 'But then, what a prospect! Colonel of Hussars, should we go to war; Secretary of Legation in time of peace; after that, Ambassador ... for I should soon have learned the business ... and had I been a mere fool,

need the son-in-law of the Marquis de La Mole fear any rival? All my foolish actions would have been forgiven me, or rather counted to me as merits. A man of distinction, enjoying the most splendid existence in Vi- enna or London ... 'Not precisely that, Sir, to be guillotined in three days' time.' Julien laughed heartily at this sally of his own wit. 'Indeed, man has two different beings inside him,' he reflected. 'What devil thought of that malicious touch? 'Very well, yes, my friend, guillotined in three days' time,' he replied to the interrupter. 'M. de Cholin will hire a window, sharing the expense with the abbe Maslon. Well, for the cost of hiring that window, which of those two worthies will rob the other?' A passage from Rotrou's Venceslas entered his head suddenly. Ladislas: My soul is well prepared. The King (his father): So is the scaf- fold; lay your head thereon. 'A good answer,' he thought, and fell asleep. Someone awakened him in the morning by shaking him violently. 'What, already!' said Julien, opening a haggard eye. He imagined him- self to be in the headsman's hands. It was Mathilde. 'Fortunately, she did not understand.' This reflection restored all his presence of mind. He found Mathilde changed as though after six months of illness: she was positively unrecognisable. 'That wretch Frilair has betrayed me,' she said to him, wringing her hands; rage prevented her from speaking. 'Was I not fine yesterday when I rose to speak?' replied Julien. 'I was improvising, and for the first time in my life! It is true that there is reason to fear it may also be the last.' At this moment Julien was playing upon Mathilde's nature with all the calm of a skilled pianist touching the keys of a piano ... 'The advantage of noble birth I lack, it is true,' he went on, 'but the great heart of Math- ilde has raised her lover to her own level. Do you suppose that Boniface de La Mole cut a better figure before his judges?' Mathilde, that morning, was tender without affectation, like any poor girl dwelling in an attic; but she could not win from him any simpler speech. He paid her back, unconsciously, the torment that she had often inflicted on him. 'We do not know the source of the Nile,' Julien said to himself; 'it has not been granted to the eye of man to behold the King of Rivers in the form of a simple rivulet: similarly no human eye shall ever see Julien weak, if only because he is not weak. But I have a heart that is easily

moved; the most commonplace words, if they are uttered with an accent of truth, may soften my voice and even make my tears begin to flow. How often have not the sere hearts despised me for this defect! They be- lieved that I was begging for mercy: that is what I cannot endure. 'They say that the thought of his wife overcame Danton at the foot of the scaffold; but Danton had given strength to a nation of coxcombs, and prevented the enemy from reaching Paris . . I alone know what I might have managed to do ... To others, I am at best only a might-have-been. 'If Madame de Renal had been here, in my cell, instead of Mathilde, should I have been able to control myself? The intensity of my despair and of my repentance would have appeared in the eyes of the Valenods, and of all the patricians of the neighbourhood, a craven fear of death; they are so proud, those feeble hearts, whom their financial position places out of reach of temptation! "You see what it is," M. de Moirod and M. de Cholin, who have just sentenced me to death, would have said, "to be born the son of a carpenter! One may become learned, clever, but courage! ... Courage is not taught at school." Even this poor Mathilde, who is now weeping, or rather who can no longer weep,' he said, look- ing at her red eyes ... and he took her in his arms: the sight of genuine grief made him forget his syllogism. 'She has been weeping all night, perhaps,' he said to himself: 'but one day how ashamed she will be when she remembers! She will regard herself as having been led astray, in early youth, by the low opinions of a plebeian ... Croisenois is weak enough to marry her, and, i' faith, he will do well for himself. She will make him play a part, "By that right Which a firm spirit planning vast designs Has o'er the loutish minds of common men." 'Ah, now; here is a pleasant thing: now that I am to die, all the poetry I ever learned in my life comes back to me. It must be a sign of decadence ... ' Mathilde kept on saying to him in a faint voice: 'He is there, in the next room.' At length he began to pay attention to her words. 'Her voice is feeble,' he thought, 'but all her imperious nature is still in its accents. She lowers her voice in order not to lose her temper. 'Who is there?' he asked her gently. 'The lawyer, to make you sign your appeal.' 'I shall not appeal.' 'What! You will not appeal,' she said, rising to her feet, her eyes ablaze with anger, 'and why not, if you please?'

'Because at this moment I feel that I have the courage to die without exciting undue derision. And who can say that in two months' time, after a long confinement in this damp cell, I shall be so well prepared? I fore- see interviews with priests, with my father ... I can imagine nothing so unpleasant. Let us die.' This unexpected obstinacy awoke all the latent pride in Mathilde's nature. She had not been able to see the abbe de Frilair before the hour at which the cells in the prison of Besancon were opened; her anger fell upon Julien. She adored him, and for the next quarter of an hour he was reminded by her imprecations against his character, her regrets that she had ever loved him, of that proud spirit which in the past had heaped such poignant insults upon him, in the library of the Hotel de La Mole. 'Heaven owed it to the glory of your race to bring you into the world a man,' he told her. 'But as for myself,' he thought, 'I should be a rare fool to live two months longer in this disgusting abode, the butt of all the infamous and humiliating lies that the patrician faction is capable of inventing, 18 my sole comfort the imprecations of this madwoman ... Well, the day after tomorrow, I shall be fighting a duel in the morning with a man well known for his coolness and for his remarkable skill ... Very remarkable,' whispered Mephistopheles, 'he never misses his stroke. 'Very well, so be it, all's well that ends well.' (Mathilde's eloquence continued to flow.) 'Begad, no,' he said to himself, 'I shall not appeal.' Having made this decision, he relapsed into his dreams ... 'The post- man on his rounds will bring the newspaper at six o'clock, as usual; at eight, after M. de Renal has read it, Elisa, entering the room on tiptoe, will lay it down on her bed. Later, she will awake: suddenly, as she reads, she will grow troubled; her lovely hand will tremble; she will come to the words: At five minutes past ten he had ceased to live. 'She will shed hot tears, I know her; in vain did I seek to murder her, all will be forgotten, and the person whose life I sought to take will be the only one who will weep sincerely for my death. 'Ah, this is a paradox!' he thought, and, for the next quarter of an hour, while Mathilde continued to make a scene, he thought only of Madame de Renal. In spite of himself, and albeit frequently replying to what Mathilde said to him, he could not free his mind from the memory of that bedroom at Verrieres. He saw the Gazette de Besancon lying on the counterpane of orange taffeta. He saw that snowy hand clutching it with a convulsive movement; he saw Madame de Renal weep ... He followed 18.A Jacobin is speaking. (Stendhal's note.)

the course of each tear over that charming face. Mademoiselle de La Mole, having failed to get anything out of Julien, made the lawyer come in. He was fortunately an old Captain of the Army of Italy, of 1796, when he had served with Manuel. For the sake of form, he opposed the condemned man's decision. Juli- en, wishing to treat him with respect, explained all his reasons to him. 'Faith, one may think as you do,' M. Felix Vaneau (this was the lawyer's name) said to him at length. 'But you have three clear days in which to appeal, and it is my duty to come back each day. If a volcano opened beneath the prison, in the next two months, you would be saved. You may die a natural death,' he said, looking at Julien. Julien shook his hand. 'I thank you, you are an honest man. I shall think it over.' And when Mathilde left him, finally, with the lawyer, he felt far more affection for the lawyer than for her.

Chapter Last Adieux An hour later, when he was fast asleep, he was awakened by the tears which he felt trickling over his hand. 'Ah! Mathilde again,' he thought to himself, half awake. 'She has come, faithful to her theory, to attack my resolve by force of tender sentiments.' Irritated by the prospect of this fresh scene in the pathetic manner, he did not open his eyes. The lines of Belphegor flying from his wife came into his mind. He heard a strange sigh; he opened his eyes; it was Madame de Renal. 'Ah! Do I see you again before my death? Is it a phantom?' he cried, as he flung himself at her feet. 'But forgive me, Madame, I am nothing but a murderer in your eyes,' he at once added, regaining his composure. 'Sir, ... I have come to implore you to appeal, I know that you do not wish to ... ' She was choked by her sobs; she was unable to speak. 'Deign to forgive me.' 'If you wish me to forgive you,' she said to him, rising and throwing herself into his arms, 'appeal at once from the sentence of death.' Julien covered her with kisses. 'Will you come and see me every day during the next two months?' 'I swear it to you. Every day, unless my husband forbids me.' 'Then I sign!' cried Julien. 'What! You forgive me! Is it possible?' He clasped her in his arms; he was mad. She uttered a faint cry. 'It is nothing,' she told him, 'you hurt me.' 'In your shoulder,' cried Julien, bursting into tears. He stepped back from her, and covered her hand with burning kisses. 'Who would ever have said, last time I saw you, in your bedroom, at Verrieres ... ?' 'Who would ever have said then that I should write M. de La Mole that infamous letter ... ?' 'Know that I have always loved you, that I have never loved anyone but you.'

'Is it really possible?' cried Madame de Renal, equally enraptured. She bowed herself over Julien, who was kneeling at her feet, and for a long time they wept in silence. At no time in his life had Julien experienced such a moment. After a long interval, when they were able to speak: 'And that young Madame Michele!' said Madame de Renal, 'or rather that Mademoiselle de La Mole; for I am beginning really to believe this strange tale!' 'It is true only in appearance,' replied Julien. 'She is my wife, but she is not my mistress ... ' And, each interrupting the other a hundred times, they managed with difficulty, each of them, to tell what the other did not know. The letter sent to M. de La Mole had been written by the young priest who directed Madame de Renal's conscience, and then copied out by her. 'What a ter- rible crime religion has made me commit!' she said to him; 'though I did modify the worst passages in the letter... .' Julien's transports of joy proved to her how completely he forgave her. Never had he been so madly in love. 'And yet I regard myself as pious,' Madame de Renal told him in the course of their conversation. 'I believe sincerely in God; I believe equally, indeed it has been proved to me, that the crime I am committing is fear- ful, and yet, as soon as I set eyes on you, even after you have fired at me twice with a pistol... ' Here, in spite of her resistance, Julien covered her with kisses. 'Let me alone,' she went on, 'I wish to argue with you, before I for- get ... As soon as I set eyes on you, all sense of duty vanishes, there is nothing left of me but love for you, or rather love is too feeble a word. I feel for you what I ought to feel only for God: a blend of respect, love, obedience ... In truth, I do not know what feeling you inspire in me. Were you to bid me thrust a knife into your gaoler, the crime would be committed before I had had time to think. Explain this to me in simple terms before I leave you, I wish to see clearly into my own heart; for in two months we must part ... For that matter, need we part?' she said, with a smile. 'I take back my word,' cried Julien, springing to his feet; 'I shall not ap- peal from the sentence of death, if by poison, knife, pistol, charcoal or any other means whatsoever, you seek to put an end to, or to endanger your life.' Madame de Renal's expression altered suddenly; the warmest affec- tion gave place to a profound abstraction.

'If we were to die at once?' she said to him at length. 'Who knows what we shall find in our next life?' replied Julien; 'torments perhaps, perhaps nothing at all. Can we not spend two months together in a delicious manner? Two months, that is ever so many days. Never shall I have been so happy.' 'You will never have been so happy?' 'Never,' replied Julien with rapture, 'and I am speaking to you as I speak to myself. Heaven preserve me from exaggeration.' 'To speak so is to command me,' she said with a timid and melancholy smile. 'Very well! You swear, by the love that you bear me, not to attempt your life by any direct means, or indirect means ... Remember,' he ad- ded, 'that you are compelled to live for my son, whom Mathilde will abandon to the care of servants as soon as she is Marquise de Croisenois.' 'I swear,' she replied coldly, 'but I mean to take away with me your ap- peal written and signed by your hand. I shall go myself to the Attorney- General.' 'Take care, you will compromise yourself.' 'After coming publicly to see you in prison, I am for ever, for Besancon and the whole of the Franche-Comte, a heroine of anecdotes,' she said with an air of profound distress. 'I have gone beyond the last limits of modesty ... I am a woman who has forfeited her honour; it is true that it was for your sake ... ' Her tone was so melancholy that Julien embraced her with a happi- ness that was quite new to him. It was no longer the intoxication of love, it was extreme gratitude. He had just realised, for the first time, the full extent of the sacrifice that she had made for him. Some charitable soul doubtless informed M. de Renal of the long visits which his wife was paying to Julien's prison; for, after three days, he sent his carriage for her, with express orders that she was to return immedi- ately to Verrieres. This cruel parting had begun the day ill for Julien. He was informed, two or three hours later, that a certain intriguing priest, who for all that had not succeeded in making any headway among the Jesuits of Bes- ancon, had taken his stand that morning outside the gate of the prison, in the street. It was raining hard, and outside there the man was trying to pose as a martyr. Julien was out of temper, this piece of foolishness moved him profoundly. That morning he had already refused a visit from the priest, but the man had made up his mind to hear Julien's confession, and to make a

name for himself among the young women of Besancon, on the strength of all the confidences which he would pretend to have received. He declared in a loud voice that he was going to remain day and night at the gate of the prison: 'God has sent me to touch the heart of this other apostate.' And the lower orders, always curious spectators of a scene, began to assemble in crowds. 'Yes, my brethren,' he said to them, 'I shall spend the day here, and the night, and every day and night from now onwards. The Holy Spirit has spoken to me. I have a mission from on high; it is I that am to save the soul of young Sorel. Join with me in my prayers,' etc., etc. Julien had a horror of scandal, and of anything that might attract atten- tion to himself. He thought of seizing the opportunity to escape from the world unknown; but he had still some hope of seeing Madame de Renal again, and was desperately in love. The gate of the prison was situated in one of the most frequented streets. The thought of that mud-bespattered priest, drawing a crowd and creating a scandal, was torture to his soul. 'And, without a doubt, at every instant he is repeating my name!' This moment was more painful than death itself. He called two or three times, at intervals of an hour, for a turnkey who was devoted to him, to send him out to see whether the priest were still at the gate of the prison. 'Sir, he is on both his knees in the mud,' was the turnkey's invariable answer; 'he is praying aloud, and repeating Litanies for your soul.' 'The impertinent fellow!' thought Julien. At that moment, indeed, he heard a dull roar, it was the crowd responding to the Litany. To increase his im- patience, he saw the turnkey move his lips as he repeated the Latin words. 'They are beginning to say,' the turnkey added, 'that your heart must indeed be hardened if you refuse the succour of this holy man.' 'O my country! How barbarous you still are!' cried Julien in a frenzy of rage. And he continued his reasoning aloud, without a thought of the turnkey's presence. 'The man wants an article in the paper, and now he is certain of obtain- ing it. 'Oh, cursed provincials! In Paris, I should not have been subjected to all these vexations. They are more adept there in charlatanism. 'Let this holy priest come in,' he said at length to the turnkey, and the sweat trickled in great drops from his brow. The turnkey made the sign of the Cross, and left the cell radiant.

The holy priest proved to be hideously ugly, and was even more foul with mud. The cold rain outside intensified the darkness and dampness of the cell. The priest tried to embrace Julien, and began to show emotion as he spoke to him. The vilest hypocrisy was all too evident; never in his life had Julien been in such a rage. A quarter of an hour after the priest had entered, Julien found himself a complete coward. For the first time death appeared to him horrible. He thought of the state of putrefaction in which his body would be two days after his execution, etc., etc. He was on the point of betraying himself by some sign of weakness, or of flinging himself upon the priest and strangling him with his chain, when it occurred to him to beg the holy man to go and say a good forty- franc mass for him, that very day. As it was almost midday, the priest decamped.

Chapter The Shadow of the Guillotine As soon as he had gone, Julien began to weep copiously, at the thought of dying. After a while he said to himself that, if Madame de Renal had been at Besancon, he would have confessed his weakness to her... . At the moment when he most regretted the absence of that beloved woman, he heard Mathilde's step. 'The worst drawback of a prison,' he thought, 'is that one can never close one's door.' All that Mathilde had to say served only to irritate him. She informed him that, on the day of the trial, M. de Valenod, having in his pocket his appointment as Prefect, had ventured to defy M. de Fri- lair and indulge himself in the pleasure of condemning Julien to death. '"Whatever induced your friend," M. de Frilair said to me just now, "to go and arouse and attack the petty vanity of that middle-class aristo- cracy? Why speak of caste? He showed them what they ought to do in their own political interest: the fools had never thought of it, and were ready to cry. This caste interest blinded their eyes to the horror of con- demning a man to death. You must admit that M. Sorel shows great in- experience. If we do not succeed in saving him by an appeal to clemency, his death will be a sort of suicide ... "' Mathilde did not, of course, mention to Julien a thing which she her- self did not yet suspect; namely, that the Abbe de Frilair, seeing Julien ir- remediably lost, thought that it would serve his own ambition to aspire to become his successor. Almost out of his mind with helpless rage and vexation: 'Go and hear a mass for me,' he said to Mathilde, 'and leave me a moment's peace.' Mathilde, who was extremely jealous already at Madame de Renal's vis- its and had just heard of her departure, realised the cause of Julien's ill humour and burst into tears. Her grief was genuine, Julien saw this and was all the more irritated. He felt a compelling need of solitude, and how was he to secure it?

Finally Mathilde, having tried every argument to soften him, left him to himself, but almost at that moment Fouque appeared. 'I want to be alone,' he said to this faithful friend. And, as he saw him hesitate: 'I am composing a memorial for my appeal to clemency ... but anyhow ... do me a favour, never to speak to me of death. If I want any special services on the day, let me be the first to mention them.' When Julien had at length secured solitude, he found himself more crushed and more of a coward than before. What little strength remained to his enfeebled spirit had been used up in the effort to conceal his condi- tion from Mademoiselle de La Mole and Fouque. Towards evening, a comforting thought came to him: 'If this morning, at the moment when death seemed so ugly, I had been warned to prepare for execution, the eye of the public would have been the incentive to glory; my gait might perhaps have been a little heavy, like that of a timid fop on entering a drawing-room. A few perspicacious people, if there be any such among these provincials, might have guessed my weakness ... but no one would have seen it.' And he felt himself relieved of part of his load of misery. 'I am a cow- ard at this moment,' he chanted to himself, 'but no one will know of it.' An almost more disagreeable incident was in store for him on the mor- row. For a long time past, his father had been threatening a visit; that morning, before Julien was awake, the white-haired old carpenter ap- peared in his cell. Julien felt utterly weak, he expected the most unpleasant reproaches. To complete his painful sensation, that morning he felt a keen remorse at not loving his father. 'Chance has placed us together on this earth,' he said to himself while the turnkey was making the cell a little tidy, 'and we have done one an- other almost all the harm imaginable. He comes in the hour of my death to deal me his final blow.' The old man's severe reproaches began as soon as they were left without a witness. Julien could not restrain his tears. 'What unworthy weakness!' he said to himself angrily. 'He will go about everywhere exaggerating my want of courage; what a triumph for Valenod and for all the dull hypocrites who reign at Verrieres! They are very great people in France, they com- bine all the social advantages. Until now I could at least say to myself: They receive money, it is true, all the honours are heaped upon them, but I have nobility at heart.

'And here is a witness whom they will all believe, and who will assure the whole of Verrieres, exaggerating the facts, that I have been weak in the face of death! I shall be said to have turned coward in this trial which they can all understand!' Julien was almost in despair. He did not know how to get rid of his father. And to make-believe in such a way as to deceive this sharp-witted old man was, for the moment, utterly beyond his power. His mind ran swiftly over all the possible ways of escape. 'I have saved money!' he exclaimed suddenly. This inspired utterance altered the old man's expression and Julien's own position. 'How ought I to dispose of it?' he continued, with more calm: the effect produced by his words had rid him of all sense of inferiority. The old carpenter was burning with a desire not to allow any of this money to escape, a part of which Julien seemed to wish to leave to his brothers. He spoke at great length and with heat. Julien managed to tease him. 'Well, the Lord has given me inspiration for making my testament. I shall give a thousand francs to each of my brothers, and the remainder to you.' 'Very good,' said the old man, 'that remainder is my due; but since God has been graciously pleased to touch your heart, if you wish to die like a good Christian, you ought first to pay your debts. There is still the cost of your maintenance and education, which I advanced, and which you have forgotten ... ' 'So that is a father's love!' Julien repeated to himself with despair in his heart, when at length he was alone. Soon the gaoler appeared. 'Sir, after a visit from the family, I always bring my lodgers a bottle of good champagne. It is a trifle dear, six francs the bottle, but it rejoices the heart.' 'Bring three glasses,' Julien told him with boyish glee, 'and send in two of the prisoners whom I hear walking in the corridor.' The gaoler brought him in two gaolbirds who had repeated their of- fence and were waiting to be sent back to penal servitude. They were a merry pair of scoundrels and really quite remarkable for cunning, cour- age and coolness. 'If you give me twenty francs,' one of them said to Julien, 'I will tell you the whole story of my life. It is as good as a play.' 'But you will tell me lies?' said Julien.

'Not at all,' was the answer; 'my friend here, who wants my twenty francs, will give me away if I don't tell the truth.' His history was abominable. It revealed a courageous heart, in which there survived but a single passion, the lust for money. After they had left him, Julien was no longer the same man. All his an- ger with himself had vanished. The piercing grief, envenomed by cow- ardice, to which he had been a prey since the departure of Madame de Renal, had turned to melancholy. 'If I had only been less taken in by appearance,' he told himself, 'I should have seen that the drawing-rooms of Paris are inhabited by hon- est people like my father, or by able rascals like these gaolbirds. They are right, the men in the drawing-rooms never rise in the morning with that poignant thought: "How am I to dine today?" And they boast of their probity! And, when summoned to a jury, they proudly condemn the man who has stolen a silver fork because he felt faint with hunger! 'But when there is a Court, when it is a question of securing or losing a Portfolio, my honest men of the drawing-rooms fall into crimes precisely similar to those which the want of food has inspired in this pair of gaolbirds ... 'There is no such thing as natural law: the expression is merely a hoary piece of stupidity well worthy of the Advocate-General who hunted me down the other day, and whose ancestor was made rich by one of Louis XIV's confiscations. There is no law, save when there is a statute to pre- vent one from doing something, on pain of punishment. Before the stat- ute, there is nothing natural save the strength of the lion, or the wants of the creature who suffers from hunger, or cold; in a word, necessity ... No, the men whom we honour are merely rascals who have had the good fortune not to be caught red-handed. The accuser whom society sets at my heels has been made rich by a scandalous injustice ... I have committed a murderous assault, and I am rightly condemned, but, short of murder only, the Valenod who condemned me is a hundred times more injurious to society. 'Ah, well,' Julien added sorrowfully, but without anger, 'for all his av- arice, my father is worth more than any of those men. He has never loved me. I am now going to fill his cup to overflowing, in dishonouring him by a shameful death. That fear of being in want of money, that exag- gerated view of the wickedness of mankind which we call avarice, makes him see a prodigious source of consolation and security in a sum of three or four hundred louis which I may leave to him. On Sunday afternoons he will display his gold to all his envious neighbours in Verrieres. "To

this tune," his glance will say to them, "which of you would not be charmed to have a son guillotined?"' This philosophy might be true, but it was of a nature to make a man long for death. In this way passed five endless days. He was polite and gentle to Mathilde, whom he saw to be exasperated by the most violent jealousy. One evening Julien thought seriously of taking his life. His spir- it was exhausted by the profound dejection into which the departure of Madame de Renal had cast him. Nothing pleased him any more, either in real life or in imagination. Want of exercise was beginning to affect his health and to give him the weak and excitable character of a young Ger- man student. He was losing that manly pride which repels with a for- cible oath certain degrading ideas by which the miserable are assailed. 'I have loved the Truth ... Where is it to be found? ... Everywhere hy- pocrisy, or at least charlatanism, even among the most virtuous, even among the greatest'; and his lips curled in disgust ... 'No, man cannot place any trust in man. 'Madame de ——, when she was making a collection for her poor orphans, told me that some Prince had just given her ten louis; a lie. But what am I saying? Napoleon at Saint-Helena! ... Pure charlatanism, a proclamation in favour of the King of Rome. 'Great God! If such a man as he, at a time, too, when misfortune ought to recall him sternly to a sense of duty, stoops to charlatanism, what is one to expect of the rest of the species? 'Where is Truth? In religion ... Yes,' he added with a bitter smile of the most intense scorn, 'in the mouths of the Maslons, the Frilairs, the Castanedes ... Perhaps in true Christianity, whose priests would be no more paid than were the Apostles? But Saint Paul was paid with the pleasure of commanding, of speaking, of hearing himself spoken of ... 'Ah! If there were a true religion ... Idiot that I am! I see a gothic cathedral, storied windows; my feeble heart imagines the priest from those windows ... My soul would understand him, my soul has need of him. I find only a fop with greasy hair ... little different, in fact, from the Chevalier de Beauvoisis. 'But a true priest, a Massillon, a Fenelon... . Massillon consecrated Dubois. The Memoires de Saint-Simon have spoiled Fenelon for me; but still, a true priest ... Then the tender hearts would have a meeting-place in this world ... We should not remain isolated ... This good priest would speak to us of God. But what God? Not the God of the Bible, a petty despot, cruel and filled with a thirst for vengeance ... but the God of Voltaire, just, good, infinite ... '

He was disturbed by all his memories of that Bible which he knew by heart ... 'But how, whenever three are gathered together, how is one to believe in that great name of GOD, after the frightful abuse that our priests make of it? 'To live in isolation! ... What torture! ... 'I am becoming foolish and unjust,' said Julien, beating his brow. 'I am isolated here in this cell; but I have not lived in isolation on this earth; I had always the compelling idea of duty. The duty that I had laid down for myself, rightly or wrongly, was like the trunk of a strong tree against which I leaned during the storm; I tottered, I was shaken. After all, I was only a man ... but I was not carried away. 'It is the damp air of this cell that makes me think of isolation ... 'And why be a hypocrite still when I am cursing hypocrisy? It is not death, nor the cell, nor the damp air, it is the absence of Madame de Ren- al that is crushing me. If I were at Verrieres, and, in order to see her, were obliged to live for weeks on end hidden in the cellars of her house, should I complain? 'The influence of my contemporaries is too strong for me,' he said aloud and with a bitter laugh. 'Talking alone to myself, within an inch of death, I am still a hypocrite ... Oh, nineteenth century! 'A hunter fires his gun in a forest, his quarry falls, he runs forward to seize it. His boot strikes an anthill two feet high, destroys the habitation of the ants, scatters the ants and their eggs to the four winds ... The most philosophical among the ants will never understand that black, enorm- ous, fearful body—the hunter's boot which all of a sudden has burst into their dwelling with incredible speed, preceded by a terrifying noise, ac- companied by a flash of reddish flame ... 'So it is with death, life, eternity, things that would be quite simple to anyone who had organs vast enough to conceive them ... 'An ephemeral fly is born at nine o'clock in the morning, on one of the long days of summer, to die at five o'clock in the afternoon; how should it understand the word night? 'Grant it five hours more of existence, it sees and understands what night is. 'And so with myself, I am to die at three and twenty. Grant me five years more of life, to live with Madame de Renal.' Here he gave a satanic laugh. What folly to discuss these great problems! 'Imprimis: I am a hypocrite just as much as if there was someone in the cell to hear me.

'Item: I am forgetting to live and love, when I have so few days left of life ... Alas! Madame de Renal is absent; perhaps her husband will not allow her to come to Besancon again, and disgrace herself further. 'That is what is isolating me, that and not the absence of a just, good, all-powerful God, who is not wicked, not hungry for vengeance ... 'Ah! If He existed ... Alas! I should fall at His feet. I have deserved death, I should say to him; but, great God, good God, indulgent God, re- store to me her whom I love!' The night was by now far advanced. After an hour or two of peaceful slumber, Fouque arrived. Julien felt himself to be strong and resolute like a man who sees clearly into his own heart.

Chapter Exit Julien 'I will not play that poor abbe Chas-Bernard the unkind trick of sending for him,' he said to Fouque; 'he would not be able to eat his dinner for three days afterwards. But try to find me a Jansenist, a friend of M. Pir- ard and beyond the reach of intrigue.' Fouque had been awaiting this development with impatience. Julien acquitted himself in a decent fashion of everything that is due to public opinion in the provinces. Thanks to M. l'abbe de Frilair, and in spite of his unfortunate choice of a confessor, Julien, in his cell, was under the protection of the Congregation; with a little more of the spirit of action, he might have made his escape. But, as the bad air of the cell produced its effect, his mental powers dwindled. This made him all the happier on the return of Madame de Renal. 'My first duty is towards you,' she said to him as she embraced him; 'I have fled from Verrieres ... ' Julien had no petty vanity in his relations with her, he told her of all his weak moments. She was kind and charming to him. That evening, immediately upon leaving the prison, she summoned to her aunt's house the priest who had attached himself to Julien as to a prey; as he wished only to acquire a reputation among the young women belonging to the best society of Besancon, Madame de Renal easily per- suaded him to go and offer a novena at the abbey of Bray-le-Haut. No words could express the intensity and recklessness of Julien's love. By spending money freely, and by using and abusing the reputation of her aunt, well known for her piety and riches, Madame de Renal ob- tained permission to see him twice daily. On hearing this, Mathilde's jealousy rose to the pitch of insanity. M. de Frilair had assured her that in spite of his position he dared not flout all the conventions so far as to permit her to see her friend more than once daily. Mathilde had Madame de Renal followed, so as to be kept in- formed of her most trivial actions. M. de Frilair exhausted every resource

of a most cunning mind, in trying to prove to her that Julien was un- worthy of her. In the midst of all these torments, she loved him all the more, and, al- most every day, created a horrible scene in his cell. Julien wished at all costs to behave like an honourable man until the end towards this poor girl whom he had so seriously compromised; but, at every moment, the unbridled passion that he felt for Madame de Ren- al overcame him. When, through some flaw in his argument, he failed to convince Mathilde of the innocence of her rival's visits: 'At this stage, the end of the play must be very near,' he said to himself; 'that is some ex- cuse for me if I cannot act better.' Mademoiselle de La Mole learned of the death of M. de Croisenois. M. de Thaler, that man of boundless wealth, had taken the liberty of saying unpleasant things about Mathilde's disappearance; M. de Croisenois called on him with a request that he would withdraw them: M. de Thaler showed him certain anonymous letters addressed to himself, and full of details so skilfully put together that it was impossible for the poor Mar- quis not to discern the true facts. M. de Thaler indulged in pleasantries that were distinctly broad. Mad with rage and misery, M. de Croisenois insisted upon reparations so drastic that the millionaire preferred a duel. Folly proved triumphant; and one of the men in Paris most worthy of a woman's love met his death in his twenty-fourth year. This death made a strange and morbid impression on Julien's weakened spirits. 'Poor Croisenois,' he said to Mathilde, 'did really behave quite reason- ably and honourably towards us; he had every right to hate me after your imprudent behaviour in your mother's drawing-room, and to seek a quarrel with me; for the hatred that follows on contempt is generally furious.' The death of M. de Croisenois altered all Julien's ideas with regard to Mathilde's future; he devoted several days to proving to her that she ought to accept the hand of M. de Luz. 'He is a shy man, not too much of a Jesuit,' he told her, 'and a man who no doubt intends to climb. With a more sober and persistent ambition than poor Croisenois, and with no dukedom in his family, he will make no difficulty about marrying Julien Sorel's widow.' 'And a widow who scorns grand passions,' replied Mathilde coldly; 'for she has lived long enough to see, after six months, her lover prefer another woman, and a woman who was the origin of all their troubles.'

'You are unjust; Madame de Renal's visits will furnish the barrister from Paris, who has been engaged to conduct my appeal, with some striking phrases; he will describe the murderer honoured by the atten- tions of his victim. That may create an effect, and perhaps one day you will see me the hero of some melodrama,' etc., etc. A furious jealousy and one that was incapable of wreaking vengeance, the prolongation of a hopeless misery (for, even supposing Julien to be saved, how was she to recapture his heart?), the shame and grief of lov- ing more than ever this faithless lover, had plunged Mademoiselle de La Mole in a grim silence from which the zealous attentions of M. de Frilair were no more capable than the rude frankness of Fouque, of making her emerge. As for Julien, except during the moments usurped by the presence of Mathilde, he was living upon love and with hardly a thought of the fu- ture. A curious effect of this passion, in its extreme form and free from all pretence, was that Madame de Renal almost shared his indifference and mild gaiety. 'In the past,' Julien said to her, 'when I might have been so happy dur- ing our walks in the woods of Vergy, a burning ambition led my soul in- to imaginary tracts. Instead of my pressing to my heart this lovely arm which was so near to my lips, the thought of my future tore me away from you; I was occupied with the countless battles which I should have to fight in order to build up a colossal fortune ... No, I should have died without knowing what happiness meant, had you not come to visit me in this prison.' Two incidents occurred to disturb this tranquil existence. Julien's con- fessor, for all that he was a Jansenist, was not immune from an intrigue by the Jesuits, and quite unawares became their instrument. He came one day to inform him that if he were not to fall into the mor- tal sin of suicide, he must take every possible step to obtain a reprieve. Now, the clergy having considerable influence at the Ministry of Justice in Paris, an easy method offered itself: he must undergo a sensational conversion ... 'Sensational!' Julien repeated. 'Ah! I have caught you at the same game, Father, play-acting like any missionary ... ' 'Your tender age,' the Jansenist went or gravely, 'the interesting ap- pearance with which Providence has blessed you, the motive itself of your crime, which remains inexplicable, the heroic measures of which Mademoiselle de La Mole is unsparing on your behalf, everything, in short, including the astonishing affection that your victim shows for you,

all these have combined to make you the hero of the young women of Besancon. They have forgotten everything for you, even politics ... 'Your conversion would strike an echo in their hearts, and would leave a profound impression there. You can be of the greatest service to reli- gion, and am I to hesitate for the frivolous reason that the Jesuits would adopt the same course in similar circumstances! And so, even in this par- ticular case which has escaped their rapacity, they would still be doing harm! Let such a thing never be said ... The tears which will flow at your conversion will annul the corrosive effect of ten editions of the impious works of Voltaire.' 'And what shall I have left,' replied Julien coldly, 'if I despise myself? I have been ambitious, I have no wish to reproach myself; I acted then ac- cording to the expediency of the moment. Now, I am living from day to day. But, generally speaking, I should be making myself extremely un- happy, if I gave way to any cowardly temptation ... ' The other incident, which affected Julien far more keenly, arose from Madame de Renal. Some intriguing friend or other had managed to per- suade this simple, timid soul that it was her duty to go to Saint-Cloud, and to throw herself at the feet of King Charles X. She had made the sacrifice of parting from Julien, and after such an ef- fort, the unpleasantness of making a public spectacle of herself, which at any other time would have seemed to her worse than death, was no longer anything in her eyes. 'I shall go to the King, I shall confess proudly that you are my lover: the life of a man, and of such a man as Julien, must outweigh all other considerations. I shall say that it was out of jealousy that you attempted my life. There are endless examples of poor young men who have been saved in such cases by the humanity of a jury, or by that of the King ... ' 'I shall cease to see you, I shall bar the door of my prison against you,' cried Julien, 'and most certainly I shall kill myself in despair, the day after, unless you swear to me that you will take no step that will make us both a public spectacle. This idea of going to Paris is not yours. Tell me the name of the intriguing woman who suggested it to you ... 'Let us be happy throughout the few remaining days of this brief life. Let us conceal our existence; my crime is only too plain. Mademoiselle de La Mole has unbounded influence in Paris, you may be sure that she is doing all that is humanly possible. Here in the provinces, I have all the wealthy and respectable people against me. Your action would embitter still further these wealthy and above all moderate men, for whom life is

such an easy matter ... Let us not give food for laughter to the Maslons, the Valenods, and a thousand people better worth than they.' The bad air of the cell became insupportable to Julien. Fortunately on the day on which he was told that he must die, a bright sun was glad- dening the earth, and he himself was in a courageous mood. To walk in the open air was a delicious sensation to him, as is treading solid earth to A mariner who has long been at sea. 'There, all is well,' he said to him- self, 'I am not lacking in courage.' Never had that head been so poetic as at the moment when it was about to fall. The most precious moments that he had known in the past in the woods of Vergy came crowding into his mind with an extreme vividness. Everything passed simply, decorously, and without affectation on his part. Two days earlier, he had said to Fouque: 'For my emotions I cannot answer; this damp and hideous cell gives me moments of fever in which I am not myself; but fear, no; no one shall see me blench.' He had made arrangements in advance that on the morning of the last day, Fouque should carry off Mathilde and Madame de Renal. 'Take them in the same carriage,' he had told him. 'Arrange that the post-horses shall gallop all the time. They will fall into one another's arms, or else will show a deadly hatred for one another. In either case, the poor women will have some slight distraction from their terrible grief.' Julien had made Madame de Renal swear that she would live to look after Mathilde's child. 'Who knows? Perhaps we continue to have sensation after our death,' he said one day to Fouque. 'I should dearly like to repose, since repose is the word, in that little cave in the high mountain that overlooks Verri- eres. Many a time, as I have told you, retiring by night to that cave, and casting my gaze afar over the richest provinces of France, I have felt my heart ablaze with ambition: it was my passion then ... Anyhow, that cave is precious to me, and no one can deny that it is situated in a spot that a philosopher's heart might envy ... Very well! These worthy members of the Congregation of Besancon make money out of everything; if you know how to set about it, they will sell you my mortal remains ... ' Fouque was successful in this grim transaction. He was spending the night alone in his room, by the body of his friend, when to his great sur- prise, he saw Mathilde appear. A few hours earlier, he had left her ten leagues from Besancon. There was a wild look in her eyes.

'I wish to see him,' she said to him. Fouque had not the courage to speak or to rise. He pointed with his finger to a great blue cloak on the floor; in it was wrapped all that re- mained of Julien. She fell upon her knees. The memory of Boniface de La Mole and of Marguerite de Navarre gave her, no doubt, a superhuman courage. Her trembling hands unfolded the cloak. Fouque turned away his eyes. He heard Mathilde walking rapidly about the room. She lighted a number of candles. When Fouque had summoned up the strength to look at her, she had placed Julien's head upon a little marble table, in front of her, and was kissing his brow ... Mathilde followed her lover to the tomb which he had chosen for him- self. A great number of priests escorted the coffin and, unknown to all, alone in her draped carriage, she carried upon her knees the head of the man whom she had so dearly loved. Coming thus near to the summit of one of the high mountains of the Jura, in the middle of the night, in that little cave magnificently illumin- ated with countless candles, a score of priests celebrated the Office of the Dead. All the inhabitants of the little mountain villages, through which the procession passed, had followed it, drawn by the singularity of this strange ceremony. Mathilde appeared in their midst in a flowing garb of mourning, and, at the end of the service, had several thousands of five franc pieces scattered among them. Left alone with Fouque, she insisted upon burying her lover's head with her own hands. Fouque almost went mad with grief. By Mathilde's orders, this savage grot was adorned with marbles sculptured at great cost, in Italy. Madame de Renal was faithful to her promise. She did not seek in any way to take her own life; but, three days after Julien, died while embracing her children.

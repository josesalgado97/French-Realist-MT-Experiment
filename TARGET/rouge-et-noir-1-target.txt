A Small Town The small town of Verrieres may be regarded as one of the most at- tractive in the Franche-Comte. Its white houses with their high pitched roofs of red tiles are spread over the slope of a hill, the slightest contours of which are indicated by clumps of sturdy chestnuts. The Doubs runs some hundreds of feet below its fortifications, built in times past by the Spaniards, and now in ruins. Verrieres is sheltered on the north by a high mountain, a spur of the Jura.

The jagged peaks of the Verra put on a mantle of snow in the first cold days of October. A torrent which comes tearing down from the mountain passes through Verrieres before emptying its waters into the Doubs, and supplies power to a great number of sawmills; this is an ex- tremely simple industry, and procures a certain degree of comfort for the majority of the inhabitants, who are of the peasant rather than of the bur- gess class. It is not, however, the sawmills that have made this little town rich. It is to the manufacture of printed calicoes, known as Mulhouse stuffs, that it owes the general prosperity which, since the fall of Napo- leon, has led to the refacing of almost all the houses in Verrieres. No sooner has one entered the town than one is startled by the din of a noisy machine of terrifying aspect. A score of weighty hammers, falling with a clang which makes the pavement tremble, are raised aloft by a wheel which the water of the torrent sets in motion. Each of these ham- mers turns out, daily, I cannot say how many thousands of nails. A bevy of fresh, pretty girls subject to the blows of these enormous hammers, the little scraps of iron which are rapidly transformed into nails. This work, so rough to the outward eye, is one of the industries that most astonish the traveller who ventures for the first time among the mountains that divide France from Switzerland. If, on entering Verrieres, the traveller inquires to whom belongs that fine nail factory which deafens everybody

who passes up the main street, he will be told in a drawling accent: 'Eh! It belongs to the Mayor.' Provided the traveller halts for a few moments in this main street of Verrieres, which runs from the bank of the Doubs nearly to the summit of the hill, it is a hundred to one that he will see a tall man appear, with a busy, important air. At the sight of him every hat is quickly raised. His hair is turning grey, and he is dressed in grey. He is a Companion of several Orders, has a high forehead, an aquiline nose, and on the whole his face is not wanting in a certain regularity: indeed, the first impression formed of it may be that it combines with the dignity of a village mayor that sort of charm which may still be found in a man of forty-eight or fifty. But soon the vis- itor from Paris is annoyed by a certain air of self-satisfaction and self-suf- ficiency mingled with a suggestion of limitations and want of originality. One feels, finally, that this man's talent is confined to securing the exact payment of whatever is owed to him and to postponing payment till the last possible moment when he is the debtor. Such is the Mayor of Verrieres, M. de Renal. Crossing the street with a solemn step, he enters the town hall and passes from the visitor's sight. But, a hundred yards higher up, if the visitor continues his stroll, he will notice a house of quite imposing appearance, and, through the gaps in an iron railing belonging to the house, some splendid gardens. Beyond, there is a line of horizon formed by the hills of Burgundy, which seem to have been created on purpose to delight the eye. This view makes the visitor forget the pestilential atmosphere of small financial interests which was beginning to stifle him. He is told that this house belongs to M. de Renal. It is to the profits that he has made from his great nail factory that the Mayor of Verrieres is indebted for this fine freestone house which he has just finished build- ing. His family, they say, is Spanish, old, and was or claims to have been established in the country long before Louis XIV conquered it. Since 1815 he has blushed at his connection with industry: 1815 made him Mayor of Verrieres. The retaining walls that support the various sec- tions of this splendid garden, which, in a succession of terraces, runs down to the Doubs, are also a reward of M. de Renal's ability as a dealer in iron. You must not for a moment expect to find in France those picturesque gardens which enclose the manufacturing towns of Germany; Leipsic, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, and the rest. In the Franche-Comte, the more walls a man builds, the more he makes his property bristle with stones

piled one above another, the greater title he acquires to the respect of his neighbours. M. de Renal's gardens, honeycombed with walls, are still further admired because he bought, for their weight in gold, certain minute scraps of ground which they cover. For instance that sawmill whose curious position on the bank of the Doubs struck you as you entered Verrieres, and on which you noticed the name Sorel, inscribed in huge letters on a board which overtops the roof, occupied, six years ago, the ground on which at this moment they are building the wall of the fourth terrace of M. de Renal's gardens. For all his pride, the Mayor was obliged to make many overtures to old Sorel, a dour and obstinate peasant; he was obliged to pay him in fine golden louis before he would consent to remove his mill elsewhere. As for the public lade which supplied power to the saw, M. de Renal, thanks to the influence he wielded in Paris, obtained leave to divert it. This favour was conferred upon him after the 182- elections. He gave Sorel four acres in exchange for one, five hundred yards lower down by the bank of the Doubs. And, albeit this site was a great deal more advantageous for his trade in planks of firwood, Pere Sorel, as they have begun to call him now that he is rich, contrived to screw out of the impatience and landowning mania which animated his neighbour a sum of 6,000 francs. It is true that this arrangement was adversely criticised by the local wiseacres. On one occasion, it was a Sunday, four years later, M. de Ren- al, as he walked home from church in his mayoral attire, saw at a dis- tance old Sorel, supported by his three sons, watching him with a smile. That smile cast a destroying ray of light into the Mayor's soul; ever since then he has been thinking that he might have brought about the ex- change at less cost to himself. To win popular esteem at Verrieres, the essential thing is not to adopt (while still building plenty of walls) any plan of construction brought from Italy by those masons who in spring pass through the gorges of the Jura on their way to Paris. Such an innovation would earn the rash build- er an undying reputation fot wrong-headedness, and he would be lost forever among the sober and moderate folk who create reputations in the Franche-Comte. As a matter of fact, these sober folk wield there the most irritating form of despotism; it is owing to that vile word that residence in small towns is intolerable to anyone who has lived in that great republic which we call Paris. The tyranny of public opinion (and what an opinion!) is as

fatuous in the small towns of France as it is in the United States of America.

Chapter A Mayor Prestige! Sir, is it nothing? To be revered by fools, gaped at by children, envied by the rich and scorned by the wise. BARNAVE Fortunately for M. de Renal's reputation as an administrator, a huge retaining wall was required for the public avenue which skirts the hill- side a hundred feet above the bed of the Doubs. To this admirable posi- tion it is indebted for one of the most picturesque views in France. But, every spring, torrents of rainwater made channels across the avenue, carved deep gullies in it and left it impassable. This nuisance, which af- fected everybody alike, placed M. de Renal under the fortunate obliga- tion to immortalise his administration by a wall twenty feet in height and seventy or eighty yards long. The parapet of this wall, to secure which M. de Renal was obliged to make three journeys to Paris, for the Minister of the Interior before last had sworn a deadly enmity to the Verrieres avenue; the parapet of this wall now rises four feet above the ground. And, as though to defy all Ministers past and present, it is being finished off at this moment with slabs of dressed stone. How often, my thoughts straying back to the ball-rooms of Paris, which I had forsaken overnight, my elbows leaning upon those great blocks of stone of a fine grey with a shade of blue in it, have I swept with my gaze the vale of the Doubs! Over there, on the left bank, are five or six winding valleys, along the folds of which the eye can make out quite plainly a number of little streams. After leaping from rock to rock, they may be seen falling into the Doubs. The sun is extremely hot in these mountains; when it is directly overhead, the traveller's rest is sheltered on this terrace by a row of magnificent planes. Their rapid growth, and handsome foliage of a bluish tint are due to the artificial soil with which the Mayor has filled in the space behind his immense retaining wall, for, despite the opposition of the town council, he has widened the avenue

by more than six feet (although he is an Ultra and I myself a Liberal, I give him credit for it), that is why, in his opinion and in that of M. Valen- od, the fortunate governor of the Verrieres poorhouse, this terrace is worthy to be compared with that of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. For my part, I have only one fault to find with the Cours de la Fidelite; one reads this, its official title, in fifteen or twenty places, on marble slabs which have won M. de Renal yet another Cross; what I should be in- clined to condemn in the Cours de la Fidelite is the barbarous manner in which the authorities keep these sturdy plane trees trimmed and pollar- ded. Instead of suggesting, with their low, rounded, flattened heads, the commonest of kitchen garden vegetables, they would like nothing better than to assume those magnificent forms which one sees them wear in England. But the Mayor's will is despotic, and twice a year every tree be- longing to the commune is pitilessly lopped. The Liberals of the place maintain, but they exaggerate, that the hand of the official gardener has grown much more severe since the Reverend Vicar Maslon formed the habit of appropriating the clippings. This young cleric was sent from Besancon, some years ago, to keep an eye upon the abbe Chelan and certain parish priests of the district. An old Surgeon-Major of the Army of Italy, in retirement at Verrieres, who in his time had been simultaneously, according to the Mayor, a Jacobin and a Bonapartist, actually ventured one day to complain to him of the periodical mutilation of these fine trees. 'I like shade,' replied M. de Renal with the touch of arrogance appro- priate when one is addressing a surgeon, a Member of the Legion of Honour; 'I like shade, I have my trees cut so as to give shade, and I do not consider that a tree is made for any other purpose, unless, like the useful walnut, it yields a return.' There you have the great phrase that decides everything at Verrieres: YIELD A RETURN; it by itself represents the habitual thought of more than three fourths of the inhabitants. Yielding a return is the consideration that settles everything in this little town which seemed to you, just now, so attractive. The stranger arriving there, beguiled by the beauty of the cool, deep valleys on every side, imagines at first that the inhabitants are influenced by the idea of beauty; they are always talking about the beauty of their scenery: no one can deny that they make a great to-do about it; but this is because it attracts a certain number of visitors whose money goes to enrich the innkeepers, and thus, through the channel of the rate-collector, yields a return to the town.

It was a fine day in autumn and M. de Renal was strolling along the Cours de la Fidelite, his lady on his arm. While she listened to her hus- band, who was speaking with an air of gravity, Madame de Renal's eye was anxiously following the movements of three little boys. The eldest, who might be about eleven, was continually running to the parapet as though about to climb on top. A gentle voice then uttered the name Adolphe, and the child abandoned his ambitious project. Madame de Renal looked like a woman of thirty, but was still extremely pretty. 'He may live to rue the day, that fine gentleman from Paris,' M. de Renal was saying in a tone of annoyance, his cheek paler even than was its wont. 'I myself am not entirely without friends at Court... .' But albeit I mean to speak to you of provincial life for two hundred pages, I shall not be so barbarous as to inflict upon you the tedium and all the clever turns of a provincial dialogue. This fine gentleman from Paris, so odious to the Mayor of Verrieres, was none other than M. Appert, 1 who, a couple of days earlier, had con- trived to make his way not only into the prison and the poorhouse of Verrieres, but also into the hospital, administered gratuitously by the Mayor and the principal landowners of the neighbourhood. 'But,' Madame de Renal put in timidly, 'what harm can this gentleman from Paris do you, since you provide for the welfare of the poor with the most scrupulous honesty?' 'He has only come to cast blame, and then he'll go back and have art- icles put in the Liberal papers.' 'You never read them, my dear.' 'But people tell us about those Jacobin articles; all that distracts us, and hinders us from doing good. 2 As for me, I shall never forgive the cure.' 1.A contemporary philanthropist and prison visitor. 2.authentic

Chapter The Bread of the Poor A virtuous priest who does not involve himself in intrigue is a blessing for the village. FLEURY It should be explained that the cure of Verrieres, an old man of eighty, but blessed by the keen air of his mountains with an iron character and strength, had the right to visit at any hour of the day the prison, the hos- pital, and even the poorhouse. It was at six o'clock in the morning pre- cisely that M. Appert, who was armed with an introduction to the cure from Paris, had had the good sense to arrive in an inquisitive little town. He had gone at once to the presbytery. As he read the letter addressed to him by M. le Marquis de La Mole, a Peer of France, and the wealthiest landowner in the province, the cure Chelan sat lost in thought. 'I am old and liked here,' he murmured to himself at length, 'they would never dare!' Turning at once to the gentleman from Paris, with eyes in which, despite his great age, there burned that sacred fire which betokens the pleasure of performing a fine action which is slightly dangerous: 'Come with me, Sir, and, in the presence of the gaoler and especially of the superintendents of the poorhouse, be so good as not to express any opinion of the things we shall see.' M. Appert realised that he had to deal with a man of feeling; he accompanied the venerable cure, visited the prison, the hospital, the poorhouse, asked many questions and, notwith- standing strange answers, did not allow himself to utter the least word of reproach. This visit lasted for some hours. The cure invited M. Appert to dine with him, but was told that his guest had some letters to write: he did not wish to compromise his kind friend any further. About three o'clock, the gentlemen went back to complete their inspection of the poorhouse, after which they returned to the prison. There they found the gaoler

standing in the doorway; a giant six feet tall, with bandy legs; terror had made his mean face hideous. 'Ah, Sir,' he said to the cure, on catching sight of him, 'is not this gen- tleman, that I see with you, M. Appert?' 'What if he is?' said the cure. 'Because yesterday I received the most definite instructions, which the Prefect sent down by a gendarme who had to gallop all night long, not to allow M. Appert into the prison.' 'I declare to you, M. Noiroud,' said the cure, 'that this visitor, who is in my company, is M. Appert. Do you admit that I have the right to enter the prison at any hour of the day or night, bringing with me whom I please?' 'Yes, M. le cure,' the gaoler murmured in a subdued tone, lowering his head like a bulldog brought reluctantly to obedience by fear of the stick. 'Only, M. le cure, I have a wife and children, if I am reported I shall be dismissed; I have only my place here to live on.' 'I too should be very sorry to lose mine,' replied the worthy cure, in a voice swayed by ever increasing emotion. 'What a difference!' the gaoler answered promptly; 'why you, M. le cure, we know that you have an income of 800 livres, a fine place in the sun ... ' Such are the events which, commented upon, exaggerated in twenty different ways, had been arousing for the last two days all the evil pas- sions of the little town of Verrieres. At that moment they were serving as text for the little discussion which M. de Renal was having with his wife. That morning, accompanied by M. Valenod, the governor of the poor- house, he had gone to the cure's house, to inform him of their extreme displeasure. M. Chelan was under no one's protection; he felt the full force of their words. 'Well, gentlemen, I shall be the third parish priest, eighty years of age, to be deprived of his living in this district. I have been here for six and fifty years; I have christened almost all the inhabitants of the town, which was no more than a village when I came. Every day I marry young couples whose grandparents I married long ago. Verrieres is my family; but I said to myself, when I saw the stranger: "This man, who has come from Paris, may indeed be a Liberal, there are far too many of them; but what harm can he do to our poor people and our prisoners?"' The reproaches of M. de Renal, and above all those of M. Valenod, the governor of the poorhouse, becoming more and more bitter:

'Very well, gentlemen, have me deprived,' the old cure had cried, in a quavering voice. 'I shall live in the town all the same. You all know that forty-eight years ago I inherited a piece of land which brings me 800 livres; I shall live on that income. I save nothing out of my stipend, gen- tlemen, and that may be why I am less alarmed when people speak of taking it from me.' M. de Renal lived on excellent terms with his wife; but not knowing what answer to make to the question, which she timidly repeated: 'What harm can this gentleman from Paris do to the prisoners?' he was just about to lose his temper altogether when she uttered a cry. Her second son had climbed upon the parapet of the wall of the terrace, and was running along it, though this wall rose more than twenty feet from the vineyard beneath. The fear of alarming her son and so making him fall restrained Madame de Renal from calling him. Finally the child, who was laughing at his own prowess, turned to look at his mother, noticed how pale she was, sprang down upon the avenue and ran to join her. He was well scolded. This little incident changed the course of the conversation. 'I am quite determined to engage young Sorel, the sawyer's son,' said M. de Renal; 'he will look after the children, who are beginning to be too much of a handful for us. He is a young priest or thereabouts, a good Latin scholar, and will bring the children on; for he has a strong charac- ter, the cure says. I shall give him 300 francs and his board. I had some doubts as to his morals; for he was the Benjamin of that old surgeon, the Member of the Legion of Honour who on pretence of being their cousin came to live with the Sorels. He might quite well have been nothing bet- ter than a secret agent of the Liberals; he said that our mountain air was good for his asthma; but that has never been proved. He had served in all Buonaparte's campaigns in Italy, and they even say that he voted against the Empire in his day. This Liberal taught young Sorel Latin, and left him all the pile of books he brought here with him. Not that I should ever have dreamed of having the carpenter's son with my children; but the cure, only the day before the scene which has made a permanent breach between us, told me that this Sorel has been studying theology for the last three years, with the idea of entering the Seminary; so he is not a Liberal, and he is a Latin scholar. 'This arrangement suits me in more ways than one,' M. de Renal went on, looking at his wife with an air of diplomacy; 'Valenod is tremend- ously proud of the two fine Norman horses he has just bought for his calash. But he has not got a tutor for his children.'

'He is quite capable of taking this one from us.' 'Then you approve of my plan?' said M. de Renal, thanking his wife, with a smile, for the excellent idea that had just occurred to her. 'There, that's settled.' 'Oh, good gracious, my dear, how quickly you make up your mind!' 'That is because I have a strong character, as the cure has had occasion to see. Let us make no pretence about it, we are surrounded by Liberals here. All these cloth merchants are jealous of me, I am certain of it; two or three of them are growing rich; very well, I wish them to see M. de Renal's children go by, out walking in the care of their tutor. It will make an impression. My grandfather used often to tell us that in his young days he had had a tutor. It's a hundred crowns he's going to cost me, but that will have to be reckoned as a necessary expense to keep up our position.' This sudden decision plunged Madame de Renal deep in thought. She was a tall, well-made woman, who had been the beauty of the place, as the saying is in this mountain district. She had a certain air of simplicity and bore herself like a girl; in the eyes of a Parisian, that artless grace, full of innocence and vivacity, might even have suggested ideas of a mildly passionate nature. Had she had wind of this kind of success, Ma- dame de Renal would have been thoroughly ashamed of it. No trace either of coquetry or of affectation had ever appeared in her nature. M. Valenod, the wealthy governor of the poorhouse, was supposed to have paid his court to her, but without success, a failure which had given a marked distinction to her virtue; for this M. Valenod, a tall young man, strongly built, with a vivid complexion and bushy black whiskers, was one of those coarse, brazen, noisy creatures who in the provinces are called fine men. Madame de Renal, being extremely shy and liable to be swayed by her moods, was offended chiefly by the restless movements and loud voice of M. Valenod. The distaste that she felt for what at Verrieres goes by the name of gaiety had won her the reputation of being extremely proud of her birth. She never gave it a thought, but had been greatly pleased to see the inhabitants of Verrieres come less frequently to her house. We shall not attempt to conceal the fact that she was reckoned a fool in the eyes of their ladies, because, without any regard for her husband's in- terests, she let slip the most promising opportunities of procuring fine hats from Paris or Besancon. Provided that she was left alone to stroll in her fine garden, she never made any complaint.

She was a simple soul, who had never risen even to the point of criti- cising her husband, and admitting that he bored her. She supposed, without telling herself so, that between husband and wife there could be no more tender relations. She was especially fond of M. de Renal when he spoke to her of his plans for their children, one of whom he intended to place in the army, the second on the bench, and the third in the church. In short, she found M. de Renal a great deal less boring than any of the other men of her acquaintance. This wifely opinion was justified. The Mayor of Verrieres owed his reputation for wit, and better still for good tone, to half a dozen pleasant- ries which he had inherited from an uncle. This old Captain de Renal had served before the Revolution in the Duke of Orleans's regiment of infantry, and, when he went to Paris, had had the right of entry into that Prince's drawing-rooms. He had there seen Madame de Montesson, the famous Madame de Genlis, M. Ducrest, the 'inventor' of the Palais-Royal. These personages figured all too frequently in M. de Renal's stories. But by degrees these memories of things that it required so much delicacy to relate had become a burden to him, and for some time now it was only on solemn occasions that he would repeat his anecdotes of the House of Orleans. As he was in other respects most refined, except when the talk ran on money, he was regarded, and rightly, as the most aristocratic per- sonage in Verrieres.

Chapter Father and Son E sara mia colpa, Se cosi e? MACHIAVELLI 'My wife certainly has a head on her shoulders!' the Mayor of Verrieres remarked to himself the following morning at six o'clock, as he made his way down to Pere Sorel's sawmill. 'Although I said so to her, to maintain my own superiority, it had never occurred to me that if I do not take this little priest Sorel, who, they tell me, knows his Latin like an angel, the governor of the poorhouse, that restless spirit, might very well have the same idea, and snatch him from me, I can hear the tone of conceit with which he would speak of his children's tutor! ... This tutor, once I've se- cured him, will he wear a cassock?' M. de Renal was absorbed in this question when he saw in the distance a peasant, a man of nearly six feet in height, who, by the first dawning light, seemed to be busily occupied in measuring pieces of timber lying by the side of the Doubs, upon the towpath. The peasant did not appear any too well pleased to see the Mayor coming towards him; for his pieces of wood were blocking the path, and had been laid there in con- travention of the law. Pere Sorel, for it was he, was greatly surprised and even more pleased by the singular offer which M. de Renal made him with regard to his son Julien. He listened to it nevertheless with that air of grudging-melan- choly and lack of interest which the shrewd inhabitants of those moun- tains know so well how to assume. Slaves in the days of Spanish rule, they still retain this facial characteristic of the Egyptian fellahin. Sorel's reply was at first nothing more than a long-winded recital of all the formal terms of respect which he knew by heart. While he was re- peating these vain words, with an awkward smile which enhanced the air of falsehood and almost of rascality natural to his countenance, the old peasant's active mind was seeking to discover what reason could be inducing so important a personage to take his scapegrace of a son into

his establishment. He was thoroughly dissatisfied with Julien, and it was for Julien that M. de Renal was offering him the astounding wage of 300 francs annually, in addition to his food and even his clothing. This last condition, which Pere Sorel had had the intelligence to advance on the spur of the moment, had been granted with equal readiness by M. de Renal. This demand impressed the Mayor. 'Since Sorel is not delighted and overwhelmed by my proposal, as he ought naturally to be, it is clear,' he said to himself, 'that overtures have been made to him from another quarter; and from whom can they have come, except from Valenod?' It was in vain that M. de Renal urged Sorel to conclude the bargain there and then: the astute old peasant met him with an obstinate refusal; he wished, he said, to consult his son, as though, in the country, a rich fath- er ever consulted a penniless son, except for form's sake. A sawmill consists of a shed by the side of a stream. The roof is held up by rafters supported on four stout wooden pillars. Nine or ten feet from the ground, in the middle of the shed, one sees a saw which moves up and down, while an extremely simple mechanism thrusts forward against this saw a piece of wood. This is a wheel set in motion by the mill lade which drives both parts of the machine; that of the saw which moves up and down, and the other which pushes the piece of wood gently towards the saw, which slices it into planks. As he approached his mill, Pere Sorel called Julien in his stentorian voice; there was no answer. He saw only his two elder sons, young gi- ants who, armed with heavy axes, were squaring the trunks of fir which they would afterwards carry to the saw. They were completely en- grossed in keeping exactly to the black line traced on the piece of wood, from which each blow of the axe sent huge chips flying. They did not hear their father's voice. He made his way to the shed; as he entered it, he looked in vain for Julien in the place where he ought to have been standing, beside the saw. He caught sight of him five or six feet higher up, sitting astride upon one of the beams of the roof. Instead of paying careful attention to the action of the machinery, Julien was reading a book. Nothing could have been less to old Sorel's liking; he might per- haps have forgiven Julien his slender build, little adapted to hard work, and so different from that of his elder brothers; but this passion for read- ing he detested: he himself was unable to read. It was in vain that he called Julien two or three times. The attention the young man was paying to his book, far more than the noise of the saw, prevented him from hearing his father's terrifying voice. Finally, despite

his years, the father sprang nimbly upon the trunk that was being cut by the saw, and from there on to the cross beam that held up the roof. A vi- olent blow sent flying into the mill lade the book that Julien was holding; a second blow no less violent, aimed at his head, in the form of a box on the ear, made him lose his balance. He was about to fall from a height of twelve or fifteen feet, among the moving machinery, which would have crushed him, but his father caught him with his left hand as he fell. 'Well, idler! So you keep on reading your cursed books, when you ought to be watching the saw? Read them in the evening, when you go and waste your time with the cure.' Julien, although stunned by the force of the blow, and bleeding pro- fusely, went to take up his proper station beside the saw. There were tears in his eyes, due not so much to his bodily pain as to the loss of his book, which he adored. 'Come down, animal, till I speak to you.' The noise of the machine again prevented Julien from hearing this order. His father who had stepped down not wishing to take the trouble to climb up again on to the machine, went to find a long pole used for knocking down walnuts, and struck him on the shoulder with it. No sooner had Julien reached the ground than old Sorel, thrusting him on brutally from behind, drove him towards the house. 'Heaven knows what he's going to do to me!' thought the young man. As he passed it, he looked sadly at the mill lade into which his book had fallen; it was the one that he valued most of all, the Memorial de Sainte-Helene. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes downcast. He was a slim youth of eighteen or nineteen, weak in appearance, with irregular but delicate fea- tures and an aquiline nose. His large dark eyes, which, in moments of calm, suggested a reflective, fiery spirit, were animated at this instant with an expression of the most ferocious hatred. Hair of a dark chestnut, growing very low, gave him a narrow brow, and in moments of anger a wicked air. Among the innumerable varieties of the human countenance, there is perhaps none that is more strikingly characteristic. A slim and shapely figure betokened suppleness rather than strength. In his child- hood, his extremely pensive air and marked pallor had given his father the idea that he would not live, or would live only to be a burden upon his family. An object of contempt to the rest of the household, he hated his brothers and father; in the games on Sundays, on the public square, he was invariably beaten. It was only during the last year that his good looks had begun to win him a few supporters among the girls. Universally despised, as a feeble

creature, Julien had adored that old Surgeon-Major who one day ven- tured to speak to the Mayor on the subject of the plane trees. This surgeon used now and then to pay old Sorel a day's wage for his son, and taught him Latin and history, that is to say all the history that he knew, that of the 1796 campaign in Italy. On his death, he had be- queathed to him his Cross of the Legion of Honour, the arrears of his pension, and thirty or forty volumes, the most precious of which had just taken a plunge into the public lade, diverted by the Mayor's influence. As soon as he was inside the house, Julien felt his shoulder gripped by his father's strong hand; he trembled, expecting to receive a shower of blows. 'Answer me without lying,' the old peasant's harsh voice shouted in his ear, while the hand spun him round as a child's hand spins a lead sol- dier. Julien's great dark eyes, filled with tears, found themselves starting into the little grey eyes of the old peasant, who looked as though he sought to penetrate to the depths of his son's heart.

Chapter Driving a Bargain Cunctando restituit rem. ENNIUS 'Answer me, without lying, if you can, you miserable bookworm; how do you come to know Madame de Renal? When have you spoken to her?' 'I have never spoken to her,' replied Julien, 'I have never seen the lady except in church.' 'But you must have looked at her, you shameless scoundrel?' 'Never! You know that in church I see none but God,' Julien added with a hypocritical air, calculated, to his mind, to ward off further blows. 'There is something behind this, all the same,' replied the suspicious peasant, and was silent for a moment; 'but I shall get nothing out of you, you damned hypocrite. The fact is, I'm going to be rid of you, and my saw will run all the better without you. You have made a friend of the parson or someone, and he's got you a fine post. Go and pack your traps, and I'll take you to M. de Renal's where you're to be tutor to the children.' 'What am I to get for that?' 'Board, clothing and three hundred francs in wages.' 'I do not wish to be a servant,' 'Animal, who ever spoke of your being a servant? Would I allow my son to be a servant?' 'But, with whom shall I have my meals?' This question left old Sorel at a loss; he felt that if he spoke he might be guilty of some imprudence; he flew into a rage with Julien, upon whom he showered abuse, accusing him of greed, and left him to go and con- sult his other sons. Presently Julien saw them, each leaning upon his axe and deliberating together. After watching them for some time, Julien, seeing that he could make out nothing of their discussion, went and took his place on the far

side of the saw, so as not to be taken by surprise. He wanted time to con- sider this sudden announcement which was altering his destiny, but felt himself to be incapable of prudence; his imagination was wholly taken up with forming pictures of what he would see in M. de Renal's fine house. 'I must give up all that,' he said to himself, 'rather than let myself be brought down to feeding with the servants. My father will try to force me; I would sooner die. I have saved fifteen francs and eight sous, I shall run away tonight; in two days, by keeping to side-roads where I need not fear the police, I can be at Besancon; there I enlist as a soldier, and, if necessary, cross the border into Switzerland. But then, good-bye to everything, good-bye to that fine clerical profession which is a stepping- stone to everything.' This horror of feeding with the servants was not natural to Julien; he would, in seeking his fortune, have done other things far more disagree- able. He derived this repugnance from Rousseau's Confessions. It was the one book that helped his imagination to form any idea of the world. The collection of reports of the Grand Army and the Memorial de Sainte-Helene completed his Koran. He would have gone to the stake for those three books. Never did he believe in any other. Remembering a saying of the old Surgeon-Major, he regarded all the other books in the world as liars, written by rogues in order to obtain advancement. With his fiery nature Julien had one of those astonishing memories so often found in foolish people. To win over the old priest Chelan, upon whom he saw quite clearly that his own future depended, he had learned by heart the entire New Testament in Latin; he knew also M. de Maistre's book Du Pape, and had as little belief in one as in the other. As though by a mutual agreement, Sorel and his son avoided speaking to one another for the rest of the day. At dusk, Julien went to the cure for his divinity lesson, but did not think it prudent to say anything to him of the strange proposal that had been made to his father. 'It may be a trap,' he told himself; 'I must pretend to have forgotten about it.' Early on the following day, M. de Renal sent for old Sorel, who, after keeping him waiting for an hour or two, finally appeared, beginning as he entered the door a hundred excuses interspersed with as many rever- ences. By dint of giving voice to every sort of objection, Sorel succeeded in gathering that his son was to take his meals with the master and mis- tress of the house, and on days when they had company in a room by himself with the children. Finding an increasing desire to raise diffi- culties the more he discerned a genuine anxiety on the Mayor's part, and

being moreover filled with distrust and bewilderment, Sorel asked to see the room in which his son was to sleep. It was a large chamber very de- cently furnished, but the servants were already engaged in carrying into it the beds of the three children. At this the old peasant began to see daylight; he at once asked with as- surance to see the coat which would be given to his son. M. de Renal opened his desk and took out a hundred francs. 'With this money, your son can go to M. Durand, the clothier, and get himself a suit of black.' 'And supposing I take him away from you,' said the peasant, who had completely forgotten the reverential forms of address. 'Will he take this black coat with him?' 'Certainly.' 'Oh, very well!' said Sorel in a drawling tone, 'then there's only one thing for us still to settle: the money you're to give him.' 'What!' M. de Renal indignantly exclaimed, 'we agreed upon that yes- terday: I give three hundred francs; I consider that plenty, if not too much.' 'That was your offer, I do not deny it,' said old Sorel, speaking even more slowly; then, by a stroke of genius which will astonish only those who do not know the Franc-Comtois peasant, he added, looking M. de Renal steadily in the face: 'We can do better elsewhere.' At these words the Mayor was thrown into confusion. He recovered himself, however, and, after an adroit conversation lasting fully two hours, in which not a word was said without a purpose, the peasant's shrewdness prevailed over that of the rich man, who was not dependent on his for his living. All the innumerable conditions which were to de- termine Julien's new existence were finally settled; not only was his salary fixed at four hundred francs, but it was to be paid in advance, on the first day of each month. 'Very well! I shall let him have thirty-five francs,' said M. de Renal. 'To make a round sum, a rich and generous gentleman like our Mayor,' the peasant insinuated in a coaxing voice, 'will surely go as far as thirty- six.' 'All right,' said M. de Renal, 'but let us have no more of this.' For once, anger gave him a tone of resolution. The peasant saw that he could advance no farther. Thereupon M. de Renal began in turn to make headway. He utterly refused to hand over the thirty-six francs for the first month to old Sorel, who was most eager to receive the money on his

son's behalf. It occurred to M. de Renal that he would be obliged to de- scribe to his wife the part he had played throughout this transaction. 'Let me have back the hundred francs I gave you,' he said angrily. 'M. Durand owes me money. I shall go with your son to choose the black cloth.' After this bold stroke, Sorel prudently retired upon his expressions of respect; they occupied a good quarter of an hour. In the end, seeing that there was certainly nothing more to be gained, he withdrew. His final reverence ended with the words: 'I shall send my son up to the chateau.' It was thus that the Mayor's subordinates spoke of his house when they wished to please him. Returning to his mill, Sorel looked in vain for his son. Doubtful as to what might be in store for him, Julien had left home in the dead of night. He had been anxious to find a safe hiding-place for his books and his Cross of the Legion of Honour. He had removed the whole of his treas- ures to the house of a young timber-merchant, a friend of his, by the name of Fouque, who lived on the side of the high mountain overlooking Verrieres. When he reappeared: 'Heaven knows, you damned idler,' his father said to him, 'whether you will ever have enough honour to pay me for the cost of your keep, which I have been advancing to you all these years! Pack up your rubbish, and off with you to the Mayor's.' Julien, astonished not to receive a thrashing, made haste to set off. But no sooner was he out of sight of his terrible father than he slackened his pace. He decided that it would serve the ends of his hypocrisy to pay a visit to the church. The idea surprises you? Before arriving at this horrible idea, the soul of the young peasant had had a long way to go. When he was still a child, the sight of certain dragoons of the 6th, in their long, white cloaks, and helmets adorned with long crests of black horsehair, who were returning from Italy, and whom Julien saw tying their horses to the barred window of his father's house, drove him mad with longing for a military career. Later on he listened with ecstasy to the accounts of the battles of the Bridge of Lodi, Arcole and Rivoli given him by the old Surgeon-Major. He noticed the burning gaze which the old man directed at his Cross. But when Julien was fourteen, they began to build a church at Verri- eres, one that might be called magnificent for so small a town. There were, in particular, four marble pillars the sight of which impressed

Julien; they became famous throughout the countryside, owing to the deadly enmity which they aroused between the Justice of the Peace and the young vicar, sent down from Besancon, who was understood to be the spy of the Congregation. The Justice of the Peace came within an ace of losing his post, such at least was the common report. Had he not dared to have a difference of opinion with a priest who, almost every fortnight, went to Besancon, where he saw, people said, the Right Rever- end Lord Bishop? In the midst of all this, the Justice of the Peace, the father of a large family, passed a number of sentences which appeared unjust; all of these were directed against such of the inhabitants as read the Constitutionnel. The right party was triumphant. The sums involved amounted, it was true, to no more than four or five francs; but one of these small fines was levied upon a nailsmith, Julien's godfather. In his anger, this man ex- claimed: 'What a change! And to think that, for twenty years and more, the Justice was reckoned such an honest man!' The Surgeon-Major, Julien's friend, was dead. All at once Julien ceased to speak of Napoleon; he announced his in- tention of becoming a priest, and was constantly to be seen, in his father's sawmill, engaged in learning by heart a Latin Bible which the cure had lent him. The good old man, amazed at his progress, devoted whole evenings to instructing him in divinity. Julien gave utterance in his company to none but pious sentiments. Who could have supposed that that girlish face, so pale and gentle, hid the unshakeable determina- tion to expose himself to the risk of a thousand deaths rather than fail to make his fortune? To Julien, making a fortune meant in the first place leaving Verrieres; he loathed his native place. Everything that he saw there froze his imagination. > From his earliest boyhood, he had had moments of exaltation. At such times he dreamed with rapture that one day he would be introduced to the beautiful ladies of Paris; he would manage to attract their attention by some brilliant action. Why should he not be loved by one of them, as Bonaparte, when still penniless, had been loved by the brilliant Madame de Beauharnais? For many years now, perhaps not an hour of Julien's life had passed without his reminding himself that Bonaparte, an obscure subaltern with no fortune, had made himself master of the world with his sword. This thought consoled him for his misfortunes which he deemed to be great, and enhanced his joy when joy came his way.

The building of the church and the sentences passed by the Justice brought him sudden enlightenment; an idea which occurred to him drove him almost out of his senses for some weeks, and finally took pos- session of him with the absolute power of the first idea which a passion- ate nature believes itself to have discovered. 'When Bonaparte made a name for himself, France was in fear of being invaded; military distinction was necessary and fashionable. Today we see priests at forty drawing stipends of a hundred thousand francs, that is to say three times as much as the famous divisional commanders un- der Napoleon. They must have people to support them. Look at the Justice here, so wise a man, always so honest until now, sacrificing his honour, at his age, from fear of offending a young vicar of thirty. I must become a priest.' On one occasion, in the midst of his new-found piety, after Julien had been studying divinity for two years, he was betrayed by a sudden blaze of the fire that devoured his spirit. This was at M. Chelan's; at a dinner party of priests, to whom the good cure had introduced him as an educa- tional prodigy, he found himself uttering frenzied praise of Napoleon. He bound his right arm across his chest, pretending that he had put the arm out of joint when shifting a fir trunk, and kept it for two months in this awkward position. After this drastic penance, he forgave himself. Such is the young man of eighteen, but weak in appearance, whom you would have said to be, at the most, seventeen, who, carrying a small par- cel under his arm, was entering the magnificent church of Verrieres. He found it dark and deserted. In view of some festival, all the win- dows in the building had been covered with crimson cloth; the effect of this, when the sun shone, was a dazzling blaze of light, of the most im- posing and most religious character. Julien shuddered. Being alone in the church, he took his seat on the bench that had the most handsome ap- pearance. It bore the arms of M. de Renal. On the desk in front, Julien observed a scrap of printed paper, spread out there as though to be read. He looked at it closely and saw: 'Details of the execution and of the last moments of Louis Jenrel, ex- ecuted at Besancon, on the ... ' The paper was torn. On the other side he read the opening words of a line, which were: 'The first step.' 'Who can have put this paper here?' said Julien. 'Poor wretch!' he ad- ded with a sigh, 'his name has the same ending as mine.' And he crumpled up the paper.

On his way out, Julien thought he saw blood by the holy water stoup; it was some of the water that had been spilt: the light from the red cur- tains which draped the windows made it appear like blood. Finally, Julien felt ashamed of his secret terror. 'Should I prove coward?' he said to himself. 'To arms!' This phrase, so often repeated in the old Surgeon's accounts of battles, had a heroic sound in Julien's ears. He rose and walked rapidly to M. de Renal's house. Despite these brave resolutions, as soon as he caught sight of the house twenty yards away he was overcome by an unconquerable shy- ness. The iron gate stood open; it seemed to him magnificent. He would have now to go in through it. Julien was not the only person whose heart was troubled by his arrival in this household. Madame de Renal's extreme timidity was disconcerted by the idea of this stranger who, in the performance of his duty, would be constantly coming between her and her children. She was accustomed to having her sons sleep in her own room. That morning, many tears had flowed when she saw their little beds being carried into the apartment intended for the tutor. In vain did she beg her husband to let the bed of Stanislas Xavier, the youngest boy, be taken back to her room. Womanly delicacy was carried to excess in Madame de Renal. She formed a mental picture of a coarse, unkempt creature, employed to scold her children, simply because he knew Latin, a barbarous tongue for the sake of which her sons would be whipped.

Chapter Dullness Non so piu cosa son, Cosa facio. MOZART (Figaro) With the vivacity and grace which came naturally to her when she was beyond the reach of male vision, Madame de Renal was coming out through the glass door which opened from the drawing-room into the garden, when she saw, standing by the front door, a young peasant, al- most a boy still, extremely pale and showing traces of recent tears. He was wearing a clean white shirt and carried under his arm a neat jacket of violet ratteen. This young peasant's skin was so white, his eyes were so appealing, that the somewhat romantic mind of Madame de Renal conceived the idea at first that he might be a girl in disguise, come to ask some favour of the Mayor. She felt sorry for the poor creature, who had come to a standstill by the front door, and evidently could not summon up courage to ring the bell. Madame de Renal advanced, oblivious for the moment of the bitter grief that she felt at the tutor's coming. Julien, who was facing the door, did not see her approach. He trembled when a pleasant voice sounded close to his ear: 'What have you come for, my boy?' Julien turned sharply round, and, struck by the charm of Madame de Renal's expression, forgot part of his shyness. A moment later, astoun- ded by her beauty, he forgot everything, even his purpose in coming. Madame de Renal had repeated her question. 'I have come to be tutor, Madame,' he at length informed her, put to shame by his tears which he dried as best he might. Madame de Renal remained speechless; they were standing close to- gether, looking at one another. Julien had never seen a person so well dressed as this, let alone a woman with so exquisite a complexion, to speak to him in a gentle tone. Madame de Renal looked at the large tears which lingered on the cheeks (so pallid at first and now so rosy) of this

young peasant. Presently she burst out laughing, with all the wild hilar- ity of a girl; she was laughing at herself, and trying in vain to realise the full extent of her happiness. So this was the tutor whom she had ima- gined an unwashed and ill-dressed priest, who was coming to scold and whip her children. 'Why, Sir!' she said to him at length, 'do you know Latin?' The word 'Sir' came as such a surprise to Julien that he thought for a moment before answering. 'Yes, Ma'am,' he said shyly. Madame de Renal felt so happy that she ventured to say to Julien: 'You won't scold those poor children too severely?' 'Scold them? I?' asked Julien in amazement. 'Why should I?' 'You will, Sir,' she went on after a brief silence and in a voice that grew more emotional every moment, 'you will be kind to them, you promise me?' To hear himself addressed again as 'Sir', in all seriousness, and by a lady so fashionably attired, was more than Julien had ever dreamed of; in all the cloud castles of his boyhood, he had told himself that no fash- ionable lady would deign to speak to him until he had a smart uniform. Madame de Renal, for her part, was completely taken in by the beauty of Julien's complexion, his great dark eyes and his becoming hair which was curling more than usual because, to cool himself, he had just dipped his head in the basin of the public fountain. To her great delight, she dis- covered an air of girlish shyness in this fatal tutor, whose severity and savage appearance she had so greatly dreaded for her children's sake. To Madame de Renal's peace-loving nature the contrast between her fears and what she now saw before her was a great event. Finally she re- covered from her surprise. She was astonished to find herself standing like this at the door of her house with this young man almost in his shirtsleeves and so close to her. 'Let us go indoors, Sir,' she said to him with an air of distinct embarrassment. Never in her life had a purely agreeable sensation so profoundly stirred Madame de Renal; never had so charming an apparition come in the wake of more disturbing fears. And so those sweet children, whom she had tended with such care, were not to fall into the hands of a dirty, growling priest. As soon as they were in the hall, she turned to Julien who was following her shyly. His air of surprise at the sight of so fine a house was an additional charm in the eyes of Madame de Renal. She

could not believe her eyes; what she felt most of all was that the tutor ought to be wearing a black coat. 'But is it true, Sir,' she said to him, again coming to a halt, and mortally afraid lest she might be mistaken, so happy was the belief making her, 'do you really know Latin?' These words hurt Julien's pride and destroyed the enchantment in which he had been living for the last quarter of an hour. 'Yes, Ma'am,' he informed her, trying to adopt a chilly air; 'I know Lat- in as well as M. le cure; indeed, he is sometimes so kind as to say that I know it better.' Madame de Renal felt that Julien had a very wicked air; he had stopped within arm's length of her. She went nearer to him, and murmured: 'For the first few days, you won't take the whip to my children, even if they don't know their lessons?' This gentle, almost beseeching tone coming from so fine a lady at once made Julien forget what he owed to his reputation as a Latin scholar. Madame de Renal's face was close to his own, he could smell the per- fume of a woman's summer attire, so astounding a thing to a poor peas- ant. Julien blushed deeply, and said with a sigh and in a faint voice: 'Fear nothing, Ma'am, I shall obey you in every respect.' It was at this moment only, when her anxiety for her children was completely banished, that Madame de Renal was struck by Julien's ex- treme good looks. The almost feminine cast of his features and his air of embarrassment did not seem in the least absurd to a woman who was extremely timid herself. The manly air which is generally considered es- sential to masculine beauty would have frightened her. 'How old are you, Sir?' she asked Julien. 'I shall soon be nineteen.' 'My eldest son is eleven,' went on Madame de Renal, completely reas- sured; 'he will be almost a companion for you, you can talk to him seri- ously. His father tried to beat him once, the child was ill for a whole week, and yet it was quite a gentle blow.' 'How different from me,' thought Julien. 'Only yesterday my father was thrashing me. How fortunate these rich people are!' Madame de Renal had by this time arrived at the stage of remarking the most trivial changes in the state of the tutor's mind; she mistook this envious impulse for shyness, and tried to give him fresh courage. 'What is your name, Sir?' she asked him with an accent and a grace the charm of which Julien could feel without knowing whence it sprang.

'They call me Julien Sorel, Ma'am; I am trembling as I enter a strange house for the first time in my life; I have need of your protection, and shall require you to forgive me many things at first. I have never been to College, I was too poor; I have never talked to any other men, except my cousin the Surgeon-Major, a Member of the Legion of Honour, and the Reverend Father Chelan. He will give you a good account of me. My brothers have always beaten me, do not listen to them if they speak evil of me to you; pardon my faults, Ma'am, I shall never have any evil intention.' Julien plucked up his courage again during this long speech; he was studying Madame de Renal. Such is the effect of perfect grace when it is natural to the character, particularly when she whom it adorns has no thought of being graceful. Julien, who knew all that was to be known about feminine beauty, would have sworn at that moment that she was no more than twenty. The bold idea at once occurred to him of kissing her hand. Next, this idea frightened him; a moment later, he said to him- self: 'It would be cowardly on my part not to carry out an action which may be of use to me, and diminish the scorn which this fine lady prob- ably feels for a poor workman, only just taken from the sawbench.' Per- haps Julien was somewhat encouraged by the words 'good-looking boy' which for the last six months he had been used to hearing on Sundays on the lips of various girls. While he debated thus with himself, Madame de Renal offered him a few suggestions as to how he should begin to handle her children. The violence of Julien's effort to control himself made him turn quite pale again; he said, with an air of constraint: 'Never, Ma'am, will I beat your children; I swear it before God.' And so saying he ventured to take Madame de Renal's hand and carry it to his lips. She was astonished at this action, and, on thinking it over, shocked. As the weather was very warm, her arm was completely bare under her shawl, and Julien's action in raising her hand to his lips had uncovered it to the shoulder. A minute later she scolded herself; she felt that she had not been quickly enough offended. M. de Renal, who had heard the sound of voices, came out of his study; with the same majestic and fatherly air that he assumed when he was conducting marriages in the Town Hall, he said to Julien: 'It is essential that I speak to you before the children see you.' He ushered Julien into one of the rooms and detained his wife, who was going to leave them together. Having shut the door, M. de Renal seated himself with gravity.

'The cure has told me that you were an honest fellow, everyone in this house will treat you with respect, and if I am satisfied I shall help you to set up for yourself later on. I wish you to cease to see anything of either your family or your friends, their tone would not be suited to my chil- dren. Here are thirty-six francs for the first month; but I must have your word that you will not give a penny of this money to your father.' M. de Renal was annoyed with the old man, who, in this business, had proved more subtle than he himself. 'And now, Sir, for by my orders everyone in this house is to address you as Sir, and you will be conscious of the advantage of entering a well- ordered household; now, Sir, it is not proper that the children should see you in a jacket. Have the servants seen him?' M. de Renal asked his wife. 'No, dear,' she replied with an air of deep thought. 'Good. Put on this,' he said to the astonished young man, handing him one of his own frock coats. 'And now let us go to M. Durand, the clothier.' More than an hour later, when M. de Renal returned with the new tu- tor dressed all in black, he found his wife still seated in the same place. She felt soothed by Julien's presence; as she studied his appearance she forgot to feel afraid. Julien was not giving her a thought; for all his mis- trust of destiny and of mankind, his heart at that moment was just like a child's; he seemed to have lived whole years since the moment when, three hours earlier, he stood trembling in the church. He noticed Ma- dame de Renal's frigid manner, and gathered that she was angry because he had ventured to kiss her hand. But the sense of pride that he derived from the contact of garments so different from those which he was accus- tomed to wear caused him so much excitement, and he was so anxious to conceal his joy that all his gestures were more or less abrupt and foolish. Madame de Renal gazed at him with eyes of astonishment. 'A little gravity, Sir,' M. de Renal told him, 'if you wish to be respected by my children and my servants.' 'Sir,' replied Julien, 'I am uncomfortable in these new clothes; I, a humble peasant, have never worn any but short jackets; with your per- mission, I shall retire to my bedroom.' 'What think you of this new acquisition?' M. de Renal asked his wife. With an almost instinctive impulse, of which she herself certainly was not aware, Madame de Renal concealed the truth from her husband. 'I am by no means as enchanted as you are with this little peasant; your kindness will turn him into an impertinent rascal whom you will be obliged to send packing within a month.'

'Very well! We shall send him packing; he will have cost me a hundred francs or so, and Verrieres will have grown used to seeing a tutor with M. de Renal's children. That point I should not have gained if I had let Julien remain in the clothes of a working man. When I dismiss him, I shall of course keep the black suit which I have just ordered from the clothier. He shall have nothing but the coat I found ready made at the tailor's, which he is now wearing.' The hour which Julien spent in his room seemed like a second to Ma- dame de Renal. The children, who had been told of their new tutor's ar- rival, overwhelmed their mother with questions. Finally Julien appeared. He was another man. It would have been straining the word to say that he was grave; he was gravity incarnate. He was introduced to the chil- dren, and spoke to them with an air that surprised M. de Renal himself. 'I am here, young gentlemen,' he told them at the end of his address, 'to teach you Latin. You know what is meant by repeating a lesson. Here is the Holy Bible,' he said, and showed them a tiny volume in 32mo, bound in black. 'It is in particular the story of Our Lord Jesus Christ, that is the part which is called the New Testament. I shall often make you re- peat lessons; now you must make me repeat mine.' Adolphe, the eldest boy, had taken the book. 'Open it where you please,' Julien went on, 'and tell me the first word of a paragraph. I shall repeat by heart the sacred text, the rule of conduct for us all, until you stop me.' Adolphe opened the book, read a word, and Julien repeated the whole page as easily as though he were speaking French. M. de Renal looked at his wife with an air of triumph. The children, seeing their parents' amazement, opened their eyes wide. A servant came to the door of the drawing-room, Julien went on speaking in Latin. The servant at first stood motionless and then vanished. Presently the lady's maid and the cook appeared in the doorway; by this time Adolphe had opened the book at eight different places, and Julien continued to repeat the words with the same ease. 'Eh, what a bonny little priest,' the cook, a good and truly devout girl, said aloud. M. de Renal's self-esteem was troubled; so far from having any thought of examining the tutor, he was engaged in ransacking his memory for a few words of Latin; at last, he managed to quote a line of Horace. Julien knew no Latin apart from the Bible. He replied with a frown:

'The sacred ministry to which I intend to devote myself has forbidden me to read so profane a poet.' M. de Renal repeated a fair number of alleged lines of Horace. He ex- plained to his children what Horace was; but the children, overcome with admiration, paid little attention to what he was saying. They were watching Julien. The servants being still at the door, Julien felt it incumbent upon him to prolong the test. 'And now,' he said to the youngest boy, 'Master Stanislas Xavier too must set me a passage from the Holy Book.' Little Stanislas, swelling with pride, read out to the best of his ability the opening words of a paragraph, and Julien repeated the whole page. That nothing might be wanting to complete M. de Renal's triumph, while Julien was reciting, there entered M. Valenod, the possessor of fine Nor- man horses, and M. Charcot de Maugiron, Sub-Prefect of the district. This scene earned for Julien the title 'Sir'; the servants themselves dared not withhold it from him. That evening, the whole of Verrieres flocked to M. de Renal's to behold the marvel. Julien answered them all with an air of gloom which kept them at a distance. His fame spread so rapidly through the town that, shortly afterwards, M. de Renal, afraid of losing him, suggested his sign- ing a contract for two years. 'No, Sir,' Julien replied coldly, 'if you chose to dismiss me I should be obliged to go. A contract which binds me without putting you under any obligation is unfair, I must decline.' Julien managed so skilfully that, less than a month after his coming to the house, M. de Renal himself respected him. The cure having quar- relled with MM. de Renal and Valenod, there was no one who could be- tray Julien's former passion for Napoleon, of whom he was careful to speak with horror.

Chapter Elective Affinities They can only touch the heart by bruising it. A MODERN The children adored him, he did not care for them; his thoughts were elsewhere. Nothing that these urchins could do ever tried his patience. Cold, just, impassive, and at the same time loved, because his coming had in a measure banished dullness from the house, he was a good tutor. For his part, he felt only hatred and horror for the high society in which he was allowed to occupy the very foot of the table, a position which may perhaps explain his hatred and horror. There were certain formal dinners at which he could barely contain his loathing of everything round about him. On Saint Louis's day in particular, M. Valenod was laying down the law at M. de Renal's; Julien almost gave himself away; he escaped into the garden, saying that he must look after the children. 'What panegyrics of honesty!' he exclaimed; 'anyone would say that was the one and only virtue; and yet what consideration, what a cringing re- spect for a man who obviously has doubled and tripled his fortune since he has been in charge of the relief of the poor! I would wager that he makes something even out of the fund set apart for the foundlings, those wretches whose need is even more sacred than that of the other paupers. Ah, monsters! Monsters! And I too, I am a sort of foundling, hated by my father, my brothers, my whole family.' Some days earlier, Julien walking by himself and saying his office in a little wood, known as the Belvedere, which overlooks the Cours de la Fidelite, had tried in vain to avoid his two brothers, whom he saw ap- proaching him by a solitary path. The jealousy of these rough labourers had been so quickened by the sight of their brother's handsome black coat, and air of extreme gentility, as well as by the sincere contempt which he felt for them, that they had proceeded to thrash him, leaving him there unconscious and bleeding freely. Madame de Renal, who was out walking with M. Valenod and the Sub-Prefect, happened to turn into

the little wood; she saw Julien lying on the ground and thought him dead. She was so overcome as to make M. Valenod jealous. His alarm was premature. Julien admired Madame de Renal's looks, but hated her for her beauty; it was the first reef on which his fortune had nearly foundered. He spoke to her as seldom as possible, in the hope of making her forget the impulse which, at their first encounter, had led him to kiss her hand. Elisa, Madame de Renal's maid, had not failed to fall in love with the young tutor; she often spoke of him to her mistress. Miss Elisa's love had brought upon Julien the hatred of one of the footmen. One day he heard this man say to Elisa: 'You won't speak to me any more, since that greasy tutor has been in the house.' Julien did not deserve the epithet; but, with the instinct of a good-looking youth, became doubly attentive to his per- son. M. Valenod's hatred was multiplied accordingly. He said in public that so much concern with one's appearance was not becoming in a young cleric. Barring the cassock, Julien now wore clerical attire. Madame de Renal observed that he was speaking more often than be- fore to Miss Elisa; she learned that these conversations were due to the limitations of Julien's extremely small wardrobe. He had so scanty a sup- ply of linen that he was obliged to send it out constantly to be washed, and it was in performing these little services that Elisa made herself use- ful to him. This extreme poverty, of which she had had no suspicion, touched Ma- dame de Renal; she longed to make him presents, but did not dare; this inward resistance was the first feeling of regret that Julien caused her. Until then the name of Julien and the sense of a pure and wholly intellec- tual joy had been synonymous to her. Tormented by the idea of Julien's poverty, Madame de Renal spoke to her husband about making him a present of linen: 'What idiocy!' he replied. 'What! Make presents to a man with whom we are perfectly satisfied, and who is serving us well? It is when he neg- lects his duty that we should stimulate his zeal.' Madame de Renal felt ashamed of this way of looking at things; before Julien came she would not have noticed it. She never saw the young cleric's spotless, though very simple, toilet without asking herself: 'Poor boy, how ever does he manage?' As time went on she began to feel sorry for Julien's deficiencies, in- stead of being shocked by them. Madame de Renal was one of those women to be found in the provinces whom one may easily take to be fools until one has known

them for a fortnight. She had no experience of life, and made no effort at conversation. Endowed with a delicate and haughty nature, that instinct for happiness natural to all human beings made her, generally speaking, pay no attention to the actions of the coarse creatures into whose midst chance had flung her. She would have been remarkable for her naturalness and quickness of mind, had she received the most scanty education; but in her capacity as an heiress she had been brought up by nuns who practised a passionate devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and were animated by a violent hatred of the French as being enemies of the Jesuits. Madame de Renal had sufficient sense to forget at once, as absurdities, everything she had learned in the convent; but she put nothing else in its place, and ended by knowing nothing. The flatteries of which she had been the precocious object, as the heiress to a large fortune, and a marked tendency towards passionate devotion, had bred in her an attitude towards life that was wholly inward. With an outward show of the most perfect submission, and a self-suppression which the husbands of Verrieres used to quote as an example to their wives, and which was a source of pride to M. de Renal, her inner life was, as a matter of fact, dictated by the most lofty disdain. Any princess who is quoted as an illustration of pride pays in- finitely more attention to what her gentlemen are doing round about her than this meekest of women, so modest in appearance, gave to anything that her husband said or did. Until Julien arrived, she had really paid no attention to anyone but her children. Their little illnesses, their sorrows, their little pleasures absorbed the whole sensibility of this human soul, which had never, in the whole of her life, adored anyone save God, while she was at the Sacred Heart in Besancon. Although she did not condescend to say so to anyone, a feverish attack coming to one of her sons threw her almost into the same state as if the child had died. A burst of coarse laughter, a shrug of the shoulders, ac- companied by some trivial maxim as to the foolishness of women, had regularly greeted the confessions of grief of this sort which the need of an outlet had led her to make to her husband during the first years of their married life. Witticisms of this sort, especially when they bore upon the illnesses of the children, turned the dagger in Madame de Renal's heart. This was all the substitute she found for the obsequious, honeyed flatteries of the Jesuitical convent in which she had passed her girlhood. She was educated in the school of suffering. Too proud to speak of griefs of this sort, even to her friend Madame Derville, she imagined that all men resembled her husband, M. Valenod, and the Sub-Prefect Charcot

de Maugiron. Coarse wit and the most brutal insensibility to everything that did not promise money, promotion or a Cross; a blind hatred of every argument that went against them seemed to her to be things natur- al to the male sex, like the wearing of boots and felt hats. After many long years, Madame de Renal had not yet grown accus- tomed to these money-grubbing creatures among whom she had to live. Hence the success of the little peasant Julien. She found much pleasant enjoyment, radiant with the charm of novelty, in the sympathy of this proud and noble spirit. Madame de Renal had soon forgiven him his ex- treme ignorance, which was an additional charm, and the roughness of his manners, which she succeeded in improving. She found that it was worth her while to listen to him, even when they spoke of the most or- dinary things, even when it was a question of a poor dog that had been run over, as it was crossing the street, by a peasant's cart going by at a trot. The sight of such a tragedy made her husband utter his coarse laugh, whereas she saw Julien's fine, beautifully arched black eyebrows wince. Generosity, nobility of soul, humanity, seemed to her, after a time, to exist only in this young cleric. She felt for him alone all the sym- pathy and even admiration which those virtues arouse in well-bred natures. In Paris, Julien's position with regard to Madame de Renal would very soon have been simplified; but in Paris love is the child of the novels. The young tutor and his timid mistress would have found in three or four novels, and even in the lyrics of the Gymnase, a clear statement of their situation. The novels would have outlined for them the part to be played, shown them the model to copy; and this model, sooner or later, albeit without the slightest pleasure, and perhaps with reluctance, vanity would have compelled Julien to follow. In a small town of the Aveyron or the Pyrenees, the slightest incident would have been made decisive by the ardour of the climate. Beneath our more sombre skies, a penniless young man, who is ambitious only because the refinement of his nature puts him in need of some of those pleasures which money provides, is in daily contact with a woman of thirty who is sincerely virtuous, occupied with her children, and never looks to novels for examples of conduct. Everything goes slowly, everything happens by degrees in the provinces: life is more natural. Often, when she thought of the young tutor's poverty, Madame de Renal was moved to tears. Julien came upon her, one day, actually crying. 'Ah, Ma'am, you have had some bad news!'

'No, my friend,' was her answer: 'Call the children, let us go for a walk.' She took his arm and leaned on it in a manner which Julien thought strange. It was the first time that she had called him 'my friend'. Towards the end of their walk, Julien observed that she was blushing deeply. She slackened her pace. 'You will have heard,' she said without looking at him, 'that I am the sole heiress of a very rich aunt who lives at Besancon. She loads me with presents. My sons are making ... such astonishing progress ... that I should like to ask you to accept a little present, as a token of my gratit- ude. It is only a matter of a few louis to supply you with linen. But—' she added, blushing even more deeply, and was silent. 'What, Ma'am?' said Julien. 'It would be unnecessary,' she went on, lowering her head, 'to speak of this to my husband.' 'I may be humble, Ma'am, but I am not base,' replied Julien coming to a standstill, his eyes ablaze with anger, and drawing himself up to his full height. 'That is a point which you have not sufficiently considered. I should be less than a footman if I put myself in the position of hiding from M. de Renal anything that had to do with my money.' Madame de Renal was overwhelmed. 'The Mayor,' Julien went on, 'has given me thirty-six francs five times since I came to live in his house; I am prepared to show my account-book to M. de Renal or to anyone else, including M. Valenod who hates me.' This outburst left Madame de Renal pale and trembling, and the walk came to an end before either of them could find an excuse for renewing the conversation. Love for Madame de Renal became more and more im- possible in the proud heart of Julien: as for her, she respected, she ad- mired him; she had been scolded by him. On the pretext of making amends for the humiliation which she had unintentionally caused him, she allowed herself to pay him the most delicate attentions. The novelty of this procedure kept her happy for a week. Its effect was to some extent to appease Julien's anger; he was far from seeing anything in it that could be mistaken for personal affection. 'That,' he said to himself, 'is what rich people are like: they humiliate one, and then think they can put things right by a few monkey-tricks.' Madame de Renal's heart was too full, and as yet too innocent for her, notwithstanding the resolutions she had made, not to tell her husband of the offer she had made to Julien and the manner in which she had been repulsed.

'What,' M. de Renal retorted, with keen annoyance, 'could you tolerate a refusal from a servant?' And as Madame de Renal protested at this word: 'I speak, Ma'am, as the late Prince de Conde spoke, when presenting his Chamberlains to his bride: "All these people," he told her, "are our servants." I read you the passage from Besenval's Memoirs, it is essential in questions of precedence. Everyone who is not a gentleman, who lives in your house and receives a salary, is your servant. I shall say a few words to this Master Julien, and give him a hundred francs.' 'Ah, my dear,' said Madame de Renal trembling, 'please do not say anything in front of the servants.' 'Yes, they might be jealous, and rightly,' said her husband as he left the room, thinking of the magnitude of the sum. Madame de Renal sank down on a chair, almost fainting with grief. 'He is going to humiliate Julien, and it is my fault!' She felt a horror of her husband, and hid her face in her hands. She promised herself that she would never confide anything in him again. When she next saw Julien, she was trembling all over, her bosom was so contracted that she could not manage to utter a single word. In her embarrassment she took his hands and wrung them. 'Well, my friend,' she said to him after a little, 'are you pleased with my husband?' 'How should I not be?' Julien answered with a bitter smile; 'he has giv- en me a hundred francs.' Madame de Renal looked at him as though uncertain what to do. 'Give me your arm,' she said at length with an accent of courage which Julien had never yet observed in her. She ventured to enter the shop of the Verrieres bookseller, in spite of his terrible reputation as a Liberal. There she chose books to the value of ten louis which she gave to her sons. But these books were the ones which she knew that Julien wanted. She insisted that there, in the bookseller's shop, each of the children should write his own name in the books that fell to his share. While Madame de Renal was rejoicing at the partial reparation which she had had the courage to make to Julien, he was lost in amazement at the quantity of books which he saw on the bookseller's shelves. Never had he dared to set foot in so profane a place; his heart beat violently. So far from his having any thought of trying to guess what was occurring in the heart of Madame de Renal, he was plunged in meditation as to how it would be possible for a young stu- dent of divinity to procure some of these books. At length the idea came

to him that it might be possible, by a skilful approach, to persuade M. de Renal that he ought to set his sons, as the subject for an essay, the lives of the celebrated gentlemen who were natives of the province. After a month of careful preliminaries, he saw his idea prove successful, so much so that, shortly afterwards, he ventured, in speaking to M. de Ren- al, to mention an action considerably more offensive to the noble Mayor; it was a matter of contributing to the prosperity of a Liberal, by taking out a subscription at the library. M. de Renal entirely agreed that it was wise to let his eldest son have a visual impression of various works which he would hear mentioned in conversation when he went to the Military School; but Julien found the Mayor obdurate in refusing to go any farther. He suspected a secret reason, which he was unable to guess. 'I was thinking, Sir,' he said to him one day, 'that it would be highly improper for the name of a respectable gentleman like a Renal to appear on the dirty ledger of the librarian.' M. de Renal's face brightened. 'It would also be a very bad mark,' Julien went on, in a humbler tone, 'against a poor divinity student, if it should one day be discovered that his name had been on the ledger of a bookseller who keeps a library. The Liberals might accuse me of having asked for the most scandalous books; for all one knows they might even go so far as to write in after my name the titles of those perverse works.' But Julien was going off the track. He saw the Mayor's features resume their expression of embarrassment and ill humour. Julien was silent. 'I have my man hooked,' he said to himself. A few days later, on the eldest boy's questioning Julien as to a book advertised in the Quotidienne, in M. de Renal's presence: 'To remove all occasion for triumph from the Jacobin Party,' said the young tutor, 'and at the same time to enable me to answer Master Adol- phe, one might open a subscription at the bookshop in the name of the lowest of your servants.' 'That is not at all a bad idea,' said M. de Renal, obviously delighted. 'Only it would have to be specified,' said Julien with that grave and al- most sorrowful air which becomes certain people so well, when they see the success of the projects which have been longest in their minds, 'it would have to be specified that the servant shall not take out any novels. Once they were in the house, those dangerous works might corrupt Madame's maids, not to speak of the servant himself.'

'You forget the political pamphlets,' added M. de Renal, in a haughty tone. He wished to conceal the admiration that he felt for the clever middle course discovered by his children's tutor. Julien's life was thus composed of a series of petty negotiations; and their success was of far more importance to him than the evidence of a marked preference for himself which was only waiting for him to read it in the heart of Madame de Renal. The moral environment in which he had been placed all his life was re- peated in the household of the worshipful Mayor of Verrieres. There, as in his father's sawmill, he profoundly despised the people with whom he lived, and was hated by them. He saw every day, from the remarks made by the Sub-Prefect, by M. Valenod and by the other friends of the family, with reference to the things that had just happened under their eyes, how remote their ideas were from any semblance of reality. Did an action strike him as admirable, it was precisely what called forth blame from the people round about him. His unspoken retort was always: 'What monsters!' or 'What fools!' The amusing thing was that, with all his pride, frequently he understood nothing at all of what was being discussed. In his whole life, he had never spoken with sincerity except to the old Surgeon-Major; the few ideas that he had bore reference to Napoleon's campaigns in Italy, or to surgery. His youthful courage took delight in detailed accounts of the most painful operations; he said to himself: 'I should not have flinched.' The first time that Madame de Renal attempted a conversation with him on a subject other than that of the children's education, he began to talk of surgical operations; she turned pale, and begged him to stop. Julien knew nothing apart from these matters. And so, as he spent his time with Madame de Renal, the strangest silence grew up between them as soon as they were alone together. In her own drawing-room, humble as his bearing was, she found in his eyes an air of intellectual su- periority over everyone that came to the house. Were she left alone for a moment with him, she saw him grow visibly embarrassed. This troubled her, for her womanly instinct made her realise that his embarrassment was not in the least degree amorous. In consequence of some idea derived from a description of good soci- ety, as the old Surgeon-Major had beheld it, as soon as conversation ceased in a place where he found himself in the company of a woman, Julien felt abashed, as though he himself were specially to blame for this silence. This sensation was a hundred times more painful when they

were alone. His imagination, full of the most extravagant, the most Span- ish notions as to what a man ought to say, when he is alone with a wo- man, offered him in his agitation none but inadmissible ideas. His soul was in the clouds, and yet he was incapable of breaking the most humili- ating silence. Thus his air of severity, during his long walks with Ma- dame de Renal and the children, was intensified by the most cruel suffer- ings. He despised himself hideously. If by mischance he forced himself to speak, he found himself saying the most ridiculous things. To increase his misery, he saw and exaggerated his own absurdity; but what he did not see was the expression in his eyes, they were so fine and revealed so burning a soul that, like good actors, they imparted at times a charming meaning to what was meaningless. Madame de Renal remarked that, when alone with her, he never expressed himself well except when he was distracted by some unforeseen occurrence, he never thought of turn- ing a compliment. As the friends of the family did not spoil her by offer- ing her new and brilliant ideas, she took a delight in the flashes of Julien's intellect. Since the fall of Napoleon, all semblance of gallantry in speech has been sternly banished from the code of provincial behaviour. People are afraid of losing their posts. The unscrupulous seek support from the Con- gregation and hypocrisy has made the most brilliant advances even among the Liberal classes. Dulness increases. No pleasure is left, save in reading and agriculture. Madame de Renal, the wealthy heiress of a religious aunt, married at sixteen to a worthy gentleman, had never in her life felt or seen anything that bore the faintest resemblance to love. Her confessor, the good cure Chelan, was the only person almost who had ever spoken to her of love, with reference to the advances of M. Valenod, and he had drawn so re- volting a picture of it that the word conveyed nothing to her but the idea of the most abject immorality. She regarded as an exception, or rather as something quite apart from nature, love such as she had found it in the very small number of novels that chance had brought to her notice. Thanks to this ignorance, Madame de Renal, entirely happy, occupied in- cessantly with the thought of Julien, was far from reproaching herself in the slightest degree.

Chapter Minor Events Then there were sighs, the deeper for suppression, And stolen glances, sweeter for the theft, And burning blushes, though for no transgression. Don Juan, I. 74 The angelic sweetness which Madame de Renal derived from her own character as well as from her present happiness was interrupted only when she happened to think of her maid Elisa. This young woman re- ceived a legacy, went to make her confession to the cure Chelan, and re- vealed to him her intention to marry Julien. The cure was genuinely de- lighted at his friend's good fortune; but his surprise was great when Juli- en informed him with a resolute air that Miss Elisa's offer could not be accepted. 'Pay good heed, my son, to what is taking place in your heart,' said the cure, frowning; 'I congratulate you on your vocation, if it is to it alone that must be ascribed your scorn of a more than adequate provision. For fifty-six years and more have I been cure at Verrieres, and yet, so far as one can see, I am going to be deprived. This distresses me, albeit I have an income of eight hundred livres. I tell you of this detail in order that you may not be under any illusion as to what is in store for you in the priestly calling. If you think of paying court to the men in power, your eternal ruin is assured. You may make your fortune, but you will have to injure the poor and needy, flatter the Sub-Prefect, the Mayor, the import- ant person, and minister to his passions: such conduct, which in the world is called the art of life, may, in a layman, be not wholly incompat- ible with salvation; but in our calling, we have to choose; we must make our fortune either in this world or in the next, there is no middle way. Go, my dear friend, reflect, and come back in three days' time with a def- inite answer. I am sorry to see underlying your character, a smouldering ardour which does not suggest to my mind the moderation and complete renunciation of earthly advantages necessary in a priest; I augur well

from your intelligence; but, allow me to tell you,' the good cure went on, with tears in his eyes, 'in the calling of a priest, I shall tremble for your salvation.' Julien was ashamed of his emotion; for the first time in his life, he saw himself loved; he wept for joy, and went to hide his tears in the great woods above Verrieres. 'Why am I in this state?' he asked himself at length; 'I feel that I would give my life a hundred times over for that good Father Chelan, and yet he has just proved to me that I am no better than a fool. It is he above all that I have to deceive, and he sees through me. That secret ardour of which he speaks is my plan for making my fortune. He thinks me unfit to be a priest, at the very moment when I imagined that the sacrifice of an income of fifty louis was going to give him the most exalted idea of my piety and my vocation. 'For the future,' Julien continued, 'I shall rely only upon those elements of my character which I have tested. Who would ever have said that I should find pleasure in shedding tears? That I should love the man who proves to me that I am nothing more than a fool?' Three days later, Julien had found the pretext with which he should have armed himself from the first; this pretext was a calumny, but what of that? He admitted to the cure, after much hesitation, that a reason which he could not explain to him, because to reveal it would injure a third party, had dissuaded him from the first from the projected mar- riage. This was tantamount to an indictment of Elisa's conduct. M. Chelan detected in his manner a fire that was wholly mundane, and very different from that which should have inspired a young Levite. 'My friend,' he appealed to him again, 'be an honest yeoman, educated and respected, rather than a priest without a vocation.' Julien replied to these fresh remonstrances extremely well, so far as words went; he hit upon the expressions which a fervent young seminar- ist would have employed; but the tone in which he uttered them, the ill- concealed fire that smouldered in his eyes alarmed M. Chelan. We need not augur ill for Julien's future; he hit upon the correct form of words of a cunning and prudent hypocrisy. That is not bad at his age. As for his tone and gestures, he lived among country folk; he had been debarred from seeing the great models. In the sequel, no sooner had he been permitted to mix with these gentlemen than he became admirable as well in gesture as in speech. Madame de Renal was surprised that her maid's newly acquired for- tune had not made the girl more happy; she saw her going incessantly to

the cure's, and returning with tears in her eyes; finally Elisa spoke to her mistress of her marriage. Madame de Renal believed herself to have fallen ill; a sort of fever pre- vented her enjoying any sleep; she was alive only when she had her maid or Julien before her eyes. She could think of nothing but them and the happiness they would find in their married life. The poverty of the small house in which people would be obliged to live, with an income of fifty louis, portrayed itself to her in enchanting colours. Julien might very well become a lawyer at Bray, the Sub-Prefecture two leagues from Ver- rieres; in that event she would see something of him. Madame de Renal sincerely believed that she was going mad; she said so to her husband, and finally did fall ill. That evening, as her maid was waiting upon her, she noticed that the girl was crying. She loathed Elisa at that moment, and had spoken sharply to her; she begged the girl's par- don. Elisa's tears increased; she said that if her mistress would allow it, she would tell her the whole tale of her distress. 'Speak,' replied Madame de Renal. 'Well, the fact is, Ma'am, he won't have me; wicked people must have spoken evil of me to him, and he believes them.' 'Who won't have you?' said Madame de Renal, scarcely able to breathe. 'And who could it be, Ma'am, but M. Julien?' the maid replied through her sobs. 'His Reverence has failed to overcome his resistance; for His Reverence considers that he ought not to refuse a decent girl, just be- cause she has been a lady's maid. After all, M. Julien's own father is no better than a carpenter; and he himself, how was he earning his living before he came to Madame's?' Madame de Renal had ceased to listen; surfeit of happiness had almost deprived her of the use of her reason. She made the girl repeat to her several times the assurance that Julien had refused in a positive manner, which would not permit of his coming to a more reasonable decision later on. 'I wish to make a final effort,' she said to her maid. 'I shall speak to M. Julien.' Next day after luncheon, Madame de Renal gave herself the exquisite sensation of pleading her rival's cause, and of seeing Elisa's hand and fortune persistently refused for an hour on end. Little by little Julien abandoned his attitude of studied reserve, and ended by making spirited answers to the sound arguments advanced by Madame de Renal. She could not hold out against the torrent of

happiness which now poured into her heart after all those days of des- pair. She found herself really ill. When she had come to herself, and was comfortably settled in her own room, she asked to be left alone. She was in a state of profound astonishment. 'Can I be in love with Julien?' she asked herself at length. This discovery, which at any other time would have filled her with re- morse and with a profound agitation, was no more to her than a singular spectacle, but one that left her indifferent. Her heart, exhausted by all that she had just undergone, had no sensibility left to place at the service of her passions. Madame de Renal tried to work, and fell into a deep sleep; when she awoke, she was less alarmed than she should have been. She was too happy to be able to take anything amiss. Artless and innocent as she was, this honest provincial had never tormented her soul in an attempt to wring from it some little sensibility to some novel shade of sentiment or distress. Entirely absorbed, before Julien came, in that mass of work which, outside Paris, is the lot of a good wife and mother, Madame de Renal thought about the passions, as we think about the lottery: a certain disappointment and a happiness sought by fools alone. The dinner bell rang; Madame de Renal blushed deeply when she heard Julien's voice as he brought in the children. Having acquired some adroitness since she had fallen in love, she accounted for her colour by complaining of a splitting headache. 'There you have women,' put in M. de Renal, with a coarse laugh. 'There's always something out of order in their machinery.' Accustomed as she was to this form of wit, the tone of his voice hurt Madame de Renal. She sought relief in studying Julien's features; had he been the ugliest man in the world, he would have charmed her at that moment. Always zealous in imitating the habits of the Court, with the first fine days of spring M. de Renal removed his household to Vergy; it is the vil- lage rendered famous by the tragic adventure of Gabrielle. A few hun- dred yards from the picturesque ruins of the old gothic church, M. de Renal owned an old castle with its four towers, and a garden laid out like that of the Tuileries, with a number of box borders, and chestnut alleys trimmed twice in the year. An adjoining field, planted with apple trees, allowed the family to take the air. Nine or ten splendid walnuts grew at the end of the orchard; their massive foliage rose to a height of some eighty feet.

'Each of those damned walnuts,' M. de Renal would say when his wife admired them, 'costs me half an acre of crop; the corn will not grow in their shade.' The rustic scene appeared to come as a novelty to Madame de Renal; her admiration knew no bounds. The feeling that animated her gave her a new spirit and determination. On the second day after their removal to Vergy, M. de Renal having returned to town upon some official business, his wife engaged labourers at her own expense. Julien had given her the idea of a little gravelled path, which should run round the orchard and beneath the big walnuts, and would allow the children to walk there in the early morning without wetting their shoes in the dew. This plan was put into execution within twenty-four hours of its conception. Madame de Renal spent a long and happy day with Julieu supervising the labourers. When the Mayor of Verrieres returned from the town, he was greatly surprised to find the path finished. His coming surprised Madame de Renal also; she had forgotten that he existed. For the next two months, he continued to speak with annoyance of their presumption in having car- ried out, without consulting him, so important a repair, but Madame de Renal had done it at her own expense, and this to some extent consoled him. She spent her days running about the orchard with her children, and chasing butterflies. They had made a number of large nets of light-col- oured gauze, with which they caught the unfortunate lepidoptera. This was the outlandish name which Julien taught Madame de Renal. For she had sent to Besancon for the handsome work on the subject by M. Godart; and Julien read to her the strange habits of these insects. They fastened them, without compunction, with pins upon a large sheet of pasteboard, also prepared by Julien. At last Madame de Renal and Julien had a subject for conversation; he was no longer exposed to the frightful torture inflicted on him by inter- vals of silence. They conversed incessantly, and with extreme interest, although al- ways of the most innocent things. This life, active, occupied and cheerful, suited everyone, except Miss Elisa, who found herself worked to death. 'Even at carnival-time,' she said, 'when there is a ball at Verrieres, Ma- dame has never taken so much trouble over her dress; she changes her clothes two or three times a day.' As it is our intention to flatter no one, we shall not conceal the fact that Madame de Renal, who had a superb skin, had dresses made for her

which exposed her arms and bosom freely. She was very well made, and this way of dressing suited her to perfection. 'You have never been so young, Ma'am,' her friends from Verrieres used to tell her when they came to dine at Vergy. (It is a local form of speech.) A curious point, which our readers will scarcely believe, was that Ma- dame de Renal had no deliberate intention in taking such pains with her appearance. She enjoyed doing so; and, without giving the matter any particular thought, whenever she was not chasing butterflies with the children and Julien, she was engaged with Elisa making dresses. Her one expedition to Verrieres was due to a desire to purchase new summer clothes which had just arrived there from Mulhouse. She brought back with her to Vergy a young woman, one of her cous- ins. Since her marriage, Madame de Renal had gradually formed an in- timate friendship with Madame Derville, who in their younger days had been her school-fellow at the Sacre-Coeur. Madame Derville laughed heartily at what she called her cousin's ab- surd ideas. 'If I were alone, they would never occur to me,' she used to say. These sudden ideas, which in Paris would have been called sallies, made Madame de Renal feel ashamed, as of something foolish, when she was with her husband; but Madame Derville's presence gave her cour- age. She began by telling her what she was thinking in a timid voice; when the ladies were by themselves for any length of time, Madame de Renal would become animated, and a long, undisturbed morning passed in a flash and left the friends quite merry. On this visit, the sensible Ma- dame Derville found her cousin much less merry and much happier. Julien, meanwhile, had been living the life of a child since he had come to the country, as happy to be running after butterflies as were his pu- pils. After so much constraint and skilful diplomacy, alone, unobserved by his fellow-men, and, instinctively, feeling not in the least afraid of Ma- dame de Renal, he gave himself up to the pleasure of being alive, so keen at his age, and in the midst of the fairest mountains in the world. As soon as Madame Derville arrived, Julien felt that she was his friend; he hastened to show her the view that was to be seen from the end of the new path; as a matter of fact it was equal, if not superior to the most admirable scenery which Switzerland and the Italian lakes have to offer. By climbing the steep slope which began a few yards farther on, one came presently to high precipices fringed with oakwoods, which projected almost over the bed of the river. It was to the summits of these sheer rocks that Julien, happy, free, and indeed something more, lord of

the house, led the two friends, and relished their admiration of those sublime prospects. 'To me it is like Mozart's music,' said Madame Derville. His brothers' jealousy, the presence of a despotic and ill-tempered father had spoiled the country round Verrieres in Julien's eyes. At Vergy, he found no trace of these unpleasant memories; for the first time in his life, he could see no one that was his enemy. When M. de Renal was in town, as frequently happened, he ventured to read; soon, instead of reading at night, and then taking care, moreover, to shade his lamp with an inverted flower-pot, he could take his full measure of sleep; during the day, in the interval between the children's lessons, he climbed up among these rocks with the book that was his sole rule of conduct, and the sole object of his transports. He found in it at once happiness, ecstasy and consolation in moments of depression. Certain things which Napoleon says of women, various discussions of the merits of the novels in vogue during his reign, furnished him now, for the first time, with several ideas which would long since have been familiar to any other young man of his age. The hot weather came. They formed the habit of spending the evening under a huge lime a few yards from the house. There the darkness was intense. One evening, Julien was talking with emphasis, he was revelling in the pleasure of talking well and to young married women; as he ges- ticulated, he touched the hand of Madame de Renal, who was leaning on the back of one of those chairs of painted wood that are placed in gardens. The hand was hurriedly withdrawn; but Julien decided that it was his duty to secure that the hand should not be withdrawn when he touched it. The idea of a duty to be performed, and of making himself ridiculous, or rather being left with a sense of inferiority if he did not succeed in per- forming it, at once took all the pleasure from his heart.

Chapter An Evening in the Country M. Guerin's Dido, a charming sketch! STROMBECK When he saw Madame de Renal again, the next morning, there was a strange look in his eyes; he watched her like an enemy with whom he would presently be engaged. This expression, so different from his ex- pression overnight, made Madame de Renal lose her head; she had been kind to him, and he appeared vexed. She could not take her eyes from his. Madame Derville's presence excused Julien from his share of the con- versation, and enabled him to concentrate his attention upon what he had in mind. His sole occupation, throughout the day, was that of forti- fying himself by reading the inspired text which refreshed his soul. He greatly curtailed the children's lessons, and when, later on, the presence of Madame de Renal recalled him to the service of his own van- ity, decided that it was absolutely essential that this evening she should allow her hand to remain in his. The sun as it set and so brought nearer the decisive moment made Julien's heart beat with a strange excitement. Night fell. He observed, with a joy that lifted a huge weight from his breast, that it was very dark. A sky packed with big clouds, kept in motion by a hot breeze, seemed to forebode a tempest. The two women continued strolling until a late hour. Everything that they did this evening seemed strange to Julien. They were enjoying this weather, which, in certain delicate natures, seems to enhance the pleasure of love. At last they sat down, Madame de Renal next to Julien, and Madame Derville on the other side of her friend. Preoccupied with the attempt he must shortly make, Julien could think of nothing to say. The conversa- tion languished.

'Shall I tremble like this and feel as uncomfortable the first time I have to fight a duel?' Julien wondered; for he had too little confidence either in himself or in others not to observe the state he was in. In this agonising uncertainty, any danger would have seemed to him preferable. How often did he long to see Madame de Renal called by some duty which would oblige her to return to the house and so leave the garden! The violence of the effort which Julien had to make to control himself was such that his voice was entirely altered; presently Madame de Renal's voice became tremulous also, but Julien never noticed this. The ruthless warfare which his sense of duty was waging with his natur- al timidity was too exhausting for him to be in a condition to observe anything outside himself. The quarter before ten had sounded from the tower clock, without his having yet ventured on anything. Julien, ashamed of his cowardice, told himself: 'At the precise moment when ten o'clock strikes, I shall carry out the intention which, all day long, I have been promising myself that I would fulfil this evening, or I shall go up to my room and blow my brains out.' After a final interval of tension and anxiety, during which the excess of his emotion carried Julien almost out of his senses, the strokes of ten sounded from the clock overhead. Each stroke of that fatal bell stirred an echo in his bosom, causing him almost a physical revulsion. Finally, while the air was still throbbing with the last stroke of ten, he put out his hand and took that of Madame de Renal, who at once with- drew it. Julien, without exactly knowing what he was doing, grasped her hand again. Although greatly moved himself, he was struck by the icy coldness of the hand he was clasping; he pressed it with convulsive force; a last attempt was made to remove it from him, but finally the hand was left in his grasp. His heart was flooded with joy, not because he loved Madame de Ren- al, but because a fearful torment was now at an end. So that Madame Derville should not notice anything, he felt himself obliged to speak; his voice, now, was loud and ringing. Madame de Renal's, on the other hand, betrayed such emotion that her friend thought she must be ill and suggested to her that they should go indoors. Julien saw the danger: 'If Madame de Renal returns to the drawing-room, I am going to fall back into the horrible position I have been in all day. I have not held this hand long enough to be able to reckon it as a definite conquest.' When Madame Derville repeated her suggestion that they should go into the drawing-room, Julien pressed the hand that lay in his.

Madame de Renal, who was preparing to rise, resumed her seat, say- ing in a faint tone: 'I do, as a matter of fact, feel a little unwell, but the fresh air is doing me good.' These words confirmed Julien's happiness, which, at this moment, was extreme: he talked, forgot to dissimulate, appeared the most charming of men to his two hearers. And yet there was still a slight want of courage in this eloquence which had suddenly come to him. He was in a deadly fear lest Madame Derville, exhausted by the wind which was beginning to rise, and heralded the storm, might decide to go in by herself to the drawing-room. Then he would be left alone with Madame de Renal. He had found almost by accident the blind courage which was sufficient for action; but he felt that it lay beyond his power to utter the simplest of words to Madame de Renal. However mild her reproaches might be, he was going to be defeated, and the advantage which he had just gained wiped out. Fortunately for him, this evening, his touching and emphatic speeches found favour with Madame Derville, who as a rule found him as awk- ward as a schoolboy, and by no means amusing. As for Madame de Ren- al, her hand lying clasped in Julien's, she had no thought of anything; she was allowing herself to live. The hours they spent beneath this huge lime, which, local tradition maintained, had been planted by Charles the Bold, were for her a time of happiness. She listened with rapture to the moaning of the wind in the thick foliage of the lime, and the sound of the first few drops that were beginning to fall upon its lowest leaves. Julien did not notice a detail which would have greatly reassured him; Ma- dame de Renal, who had been obliged to remove her hand from his, on rising to help her cousin to pick up a pot of flowers which the wind had overturned at their feet, had no sooner sat down again than she gave him back her hand almost without difficulty, and as though it had been an understood thing between them. Midnight had long since struck; at length it was time to leave the garden: the party broke up. Madame de Renal, transported by the joy of being in love, was so ignorant that she hardly reproached herself at all. Happiness robbed her of sleep. A sleep like lead carried off Julien, ut- terly worn out by the battle that had been raging all day in his heart between timidity and pride. Next morning he was called at five o'clock; and (what would have been a cruel blow to Madame de Renal had she known of it) he barely gave her a thought. He had done his duty, and a heroic duty. Filled with

joy by this sentiment, he turned the key in the door of his bedroom and gave himself up with an entirely new pleasure to reading about the ex- ploits of his hero. When the luncheon bell sounded, he had forgotten, in reading the re- ports of the Grand Army, all the advantages he had won overnight. He said to himself, in a careless tone, as he went down to the drawing-room: 'I must tell this woman that I love her.' Instead of that gaze charged with passion which he expected to meet, he found the stern face of M. de Renal, who, having arrived a couple of hours earlier from Verrieres, did not conceal his displeasure on finding that Julien was wasting the whole morning without attending to the chil- dren. No sight could have been so unprepossessing as that of this self- important man, conscious of a grievance and confident of his right to let it be seen. Each of her husband's harsh words pierced Madame de Renal to the heart. As for Julien, he was so plunged in ecstasy, still so absorbed in the great events which for the last few hours had been happening before his eyes, that at first he could barely lower the pitch of his attention to listen to the stern voice of M. de Renal. At length he answered him, sharply enough: 'I was unwell.' The tone of this reply would have stung a man far less susceptible than the Mayor of Verrieres; it occurred to him to reply to Julien with an immediate dismissal. He was restrained only by the maxim which he had laid down for himself, never to be too hasty in business matters. 'This young fool,' he soon reminded himself, 'has made himself a sort of reputation in my house; Valenod may take him on, or else he will marry Elisa, and, in either case, he can afford to laugh at me in his heart.' Despite the wisdom of these reflections, M. de Renal's displeasure found an outlet nevertheless in a succession of coarse utterances which succeeded in irritating Julien. Madame de Renal was on the point of sub- siding in tears. As soon as the meal was ended, she asked Julien to give her his arm for their walk; she leaned upon it in a friendly way. To all that Madame de Renal said to him, Julien could only murmur in reply: 'This is what rich people are like!' M. de Renal kept close beside them; his presence increased Julien's an- ger. He noticed suddenly that Madame de Renal was leaning upon his arm in a marked manner; this action horrified him, he repulsed her viol- ently, freeing his arm from hers.

Fortunately M. de Renal saw nothing of this fresh impertinence; it was noticed only by Madame Derville; her friend burst into tears. At this mo- ment M. de Renal began flinging stones at a little peasant girl who was trespassing by taking a short cut across a corner of the orchard. 'Monsieur Julien, kindly control yourself, remember that we are all of us liable to moments of ill temper,' Madame Derville said hastily. Julien looked at her coldly with eyes in which the loftiest contempt was portrayed. This look astonished Madame Derville, and would have surprised her far more could she have guessed its full meaning; she would have read in it a vague hope of the most terrible revenge. It is doubtless to such moments of humiliation that we owe men like Robespierre. 'Your Julien is very violent, he frightens me,' Madame Derville mur- mured to her friend. 'He has every reason to be angry,' the other replied. 'After the aston- ishing progress the children have made with him, what does it matter if he spends a morning without speaking to them? You must admit that gentlemen are very hard.' For the first time in her life, Madame de Renal felt a sort of desire to be avenged on her husband. The intense hatred that animated Julien against rich people was about to break forth. Fortunately M. de Renal called for his gardener, with whom for the rest of the time he busied himself in stopping up with faggots of thorn the short cut that had been made across the orchard. Julien did not utter a single word in reply to the at- tentions that were shown him throughout the remainder of the walk. As soon as M. de Renal had left them, the two ladies, on the plea that they were tired, had asked him each for an arm. As he walked between these women whose cheeks were flushed with the embarrassment of an intense discomfort, Julien's sombre and decided air formed a striking contrast. He despised these women, and all tender feelings. 'What!' he said to himself, 'not even an allowance of five hundred francs to complete my studies! Ah! How I should send her packing!' Absorbed in these drastic thoughts, the little that he deigned to take in of the polite speeches of the two ladies displeased him as being devoid of meaning, silly, feeble, in a word feminine. By dint of talking for talking's sake, and of trying to keep the conversa- tion alive, Madame de Renal found herself saying that her husband had come from Verrieres because he had made a bargain, for the purchase of

maize straw, with one of his farmers. (In this district maize straw is used to stuff the palliasses of the beds.) 'My husband will not be joining us again,' Madame de Renal went on: 'he will be busy with the gardener and his valet changing the straw in all the palliasses in the house. This morning he put fresh straw on all the beds on the first floor, now he is at work on the second.' Julien changed colour; he looked at Madame de Renal in an odd man- ner, and presently drew her apart, so to speak, by increasing his pace. Madame Derville allowed them to move away from her. 'Save my life,' said Julien to Madame de Renal, 'you alone can do it; for you know that the valet hates me like poison. I must confess to you, Ma'am, that I have a portrait; I have hidden it in the palliasse on my bed.' At these words, Madame de Renal in turn grew pale. 'You alone, Ma'am, can go into my room at this moment; feel, without letting yourself be observed, in the corner of the palliasse nearest to the window; you will find there a small box of shiny black pasteboard.' 'It contains a portrait?' said Madame de Renal, barely able to stand. Her air of disappointment was noticed by Julien, who at once took ad- vantage of it. 'I have a second favour to ask of you, Ma'am; I beg you not to look at the portrait, it is my secret.' 'It is a secret!' repeated Madame de Renal, in faint accents. But, albeit she had been reared among people proud of their wealth, and sensible of pecuniary interests alone, love had already instilled some generosity into her heart. Though cruelly wounded, it was with an air of the simplest devotion that Madame de Renal put to Julien the questions necessary to enable her to execute his commission properly. 'And so,' she said, as she left him, 'it is a little round box, of black pasteboard, and very shiny.' 'Yes, Ma'am,' replied Julien in that hard tone which danger gives a man. She mounted to the second floor of the house, as pale as though she were going to her death. To complete her misery she felt that she was on the point of fainting, but the necessity of doing Julien a service restored her strength. 'I must have that box,' she said to herself as she quickened her pace. She could hear her husband talking to the valet, actually in Julien's room. Fortunately they moved into the room in which the children slept. She lifted the mattress and plunged her hand into the straw with such force as to scratch her fingers. But, although extremely sensitive to slight

injuries of this sort, she was now quite unconscious of the pain, for al- most immediately she felt the polished surface of the pasteboard box. She seized it and fled. No sooner was she rid of the fear of being surprised by her husband, than the horror inspired in her by this box made her feel that in another minute she must unquestionably faint. 'So Julien is in love, and I have here the portrait of the woman he loves.' Seated on a chair in the sitting-room of this apartment, Madame de Renal fell a prey to all the horrors of jealousy. Her extreme ignorance was of service to her again at this moment; astonishment tempered her grief. Julien appeared, snatched the box, without thanking her, without saying a word, and ran into his bedroom, where he struck a light and im- mediately destroyed it. He was pale, speechless; he exaggerated to him- self the risk he had been running. 'The portrait of Napoleon,' he said to himself with a toss of the head, 'found hidden in the room of a man who professes such hatred for the usurper! Found by M. de Renal, so ultra and so angry! and, to complete the imprudence, on the white card at the back of the portrait, lines in my writing! And lines that can leave no doubt as to the warmth of my ad- miration! And each of those transports of love is dated! There was one only two days ago! 'All my reputation brought down, destroyed in a moment!' Julien said to himself as he watched the box burn, 'and my reputation is all I have, I live by it alone ... and what a life at that, great God!' An hour later, his exhaustion and the pity he felt for himself disposed him to feel affection. He met Madame de Renal and took her hand which he kissed with more sincerity than he had ever yet shown. She coloured with delight, and almost simultaneously repulsed Julien with the anger of a jealous woman. Julien's pride, so recently wounded, made a fool of him at that moment. He saw in Madame de Renal only a rich woman, he let fall her hand with contempt, and strode away. He went out and walked pensively in the garden; presently a bitter smile appeared on his lips. 'Here I am walking about as calm as a man who is his own master! I am not looking after the children! I am exposing myself to the humiliat- ing remarks of M. de Renal, and he will be justified.' He hastened to the children's room. The caresses of the youngest boy, to whom he was greatly attached, did something to soothe his agonising pain.

'This one does not despise me yet,' thought Julien. But presently he blamed himself for this relief from pain, as for a fresh weakness. These children fondle me as they might fondle the puppy that was bought yesterday.'

Chapter A Large Heart and a Small Fortune But passion most dissembles, yet betrays, Even by its darkness; as the blackest sky Foretells the heaviest tempest. Don Juan, I. 73 M. de Renal, who was visiting every room in the house, reappeared in the children's room with the servants who brought back the palliasses re- filled. The sudden entry of this man was the last straw to Julien. Paler, more sombre than usual, he advanced towards him. M. de Renal stood still and looked at his servants. 'Sir,' Julien began, 'do you suppose that with any other tutor your chil- dren would have made the same progress that they have made with me? If your answer is no,' he went on without giving M. de Renal time to speak, 'how dare you presume to reproach me with neglecting them?' M. de Renal, who had barely recovered from his alarm, concluded from the strange tone which he saw this young peasant adopt that he had in his pocket some more attractive offer and was going to leave him. Julien's anger increasing as he spoke: 'I can live without you, Sir,' he concluded. 'I am extremely sorry to see you so agitated,' replied M. de Renal, stammering a little. The servants were a few feet away, and were occu- pied in making the beds. 'That is not enough for me, Sir,' Julien went on, beside himself with rage; 'think of the abominable things you said to me, and in the presence of ladies, too!' M. de Renal was only too well aware of what Julien was asking, and conflicting passions did battle in his heart. It so happened that Julien, now really mad with rage, exclaimed: 'I know where to go, Sir, when I leave your house.' On hearing these words, M. de Renal had a vision of Julien established in M. Valenod's household.

'Very well, Sir,' he said at length with a sigh, and the air of a man call- ing in a surgeon to perform the most painful operation, 'I agree to your request. From the day after tomorrow, which is the first of the month, I shall give you fifty francs monthly.' Julien wanted to laugh and remained speechless: his anger had com- pletely vanished. 'I did not despise the animal enough,' he said to himself. 'This, no doubt, is the most ample apology so base a nature is capable of making.' The children, who had listened to this scene open-mouthed, ran to the garden to tell their mother that M. Julien was in a great rage, but that he was to have fifty francs a month. Julien went after them from force of habit, without so much as a glance at M. de Renal, whom he left in a state of intense annoyance. 'That's a hundred and sixty-eight francs,' the Mayor said to himself, 'that M. Valenod has cost me. I must really say a few firm words to him about his contract to supply the foundlings.' A moment later, Julien again stood before him. 'I have a matter of conscience to discuss with M. Chelan. I have the honour to inform you that I shall be absent for some hours.' 'Ah, my dear Julien,' said M. de Renal, laughing in the most insincere manner, 'the whole day, if you wish, the whole of tomorrow, my worthy friend. Take the gardener's horse to go to Verrieres.' 'There,' M. de Renal said to himself, 'he's going with an answer to Valenod; he's given me no promise, but we must let the young hothead cool down.' Julien made a speedy escape and climbed up among the big woods through which one can go from Vergy to Verrieres. He was in no hurry to reach M. Chelan's. So far from desiring to involve himself in a fresh display of hypocrisy, he needed time to see clearly into his own heart, and to give audience to the swarm of conflicting feelings that disturbed it. 'I have won a battle,' he said to himself as soon as he found himself in the shelter of the woods and out of sight of anyone, 'I have really won a battle!' The last word painted his whole position for him in glowing colours, and restored some degree of tranquillity to his heart. 'Here I am with a salary of fifty francs a month; M. de Renal must be in a fine fright. But of what?' His meditation as to what could have frightened the prosperous and powerful man against whom, an hour earlier, he had been seething with

rage completely restored Julien's serenity. He was almost conscious, for a moment, of the exquisite beauty of the woods through which he was walking. Enormous fragments of bare rock had in times past fallen into the heart of the forest from the side of the mountain. Tall beeches rose al- most as high as these rocks whose shadow provided a delicious coolness within a few yards of places where the heat of the sun's rays would have made it impossible to stop. Julien paused for a breathing-space in the shadow of these great rocks, then went on climbing. Presently, by following a narrow path, barely vis- ible and used only by goatherds, he found himself standing upon an im- mense rock, where he could be certain of his complete isolation from his fellow-men. This natural position made him smile, it suggested to him the position to which he was burning to attain in the moral sphere. The pure air of these lofty mountains breathed serenity and even joy into his soul. The Mayor of Verrieres might still, in his eyes, be typical of all the rich and insolent denizens of the earth, but Julien felt that the hatred which had convulsed him that afternoon contained, notwithstanding its violence, no element of personal ill-feeling. Should he cease to see M. de Renal, within a week he would have forgotten him, the man himself, his house, his dogs, his children and all that was his. 'I have forced him, I do not know how, to make the greatest of sacrifices. What, more than fifty crowns a year? A moment earlier I had just escaped from the greatest danger. That makes two victories in one day; the second contains no merit, I must try to discover the reason. But we can leave such arduous research for tomorrow.' Julien, erect upon his mighty rock, gazed at the sky, kindled to flame by an August sun. The grasshoppers were chirping in the patch of mead- ow beneath the rock; when they ceased everything around him was si- lence. Twenty leagues of country lay at his feet. From time to time a hawk, risen from the bare cliffs above his head, caught his eye as it wheeled silently in its vast circles. Julien's eye followed mechanically the bird of prey. Its calm, powerful motion impressed him, he envied such strength, he envied such isolation. It was the destiny of Napoleon, was it one day to be his own?

Chapter Night Thoughts Yet Julia's very coldness still was kind, And tremulously gentle her small hand Withdrew itself from his, but left behind A little pressure, thrilling, and so bland And slight, so very slight, that to the mind Twas but a doubt. Don Juan, I. 71 He must, however, let himself be seen at Verrieres. As he left the Pres- bytery the first person he met was, by a happy chance, M. Valenod, whom he hastened to inform of the increase in his salary. On his return to Vergy, Julien did not go down to the garden until night had set in. His heart was worn out by the multitude of powerful emotions that had assailed it in the course of the day. 'What shall I say to them?' he asked himself anxiously, thinking of the ladies. It never oc- curred to him that his spirits were precisely at the level of the trivial hap- penings that as a rule occupy the whole interest of women. Often Julien was unintelligible to Madame Derville, and even to her friend, while he in turn only half understood all that they were saying to him. Such was the effect of the force, and, if I may use the word, of the magnitude of the waves of passion on which the heart of this ambitious youth was being tossed. In this strange creature almost every day was one of storm. When he went into the garden that evening, Julien was ready to listen with interest to the thoughts of the fair cousins. They awaited his coming with impatience. He took his accustomed seat, by Madame de Renal's side. The darkness soon became intense. He attempted to clasp a white hand which for some time he had seen close beside him, resting on the back of a chair. There was some hesitation shown, but finally the hand was withdrawn from him in a manner which betokened displeasure. Julien was prepared to regard this as final, and to continue the conversa- tion in a light tone, when he heard M. de Renal approach. The rude words of the morning still rang in Julien's ears. 'Would it not,' he said to himself, 'be a good way of scoring off this creature, so

lavishly endowed with every material advantage, to take possession of his wife's hand under his very eyes? Yes, I will do it, I, for whom he has shown such contempt.' > From that moment peace of mind, so ill assorted to Julien's character, speedily vanished; he desired most anxiously, and without being able to fix his mind on anything else, that Madame de Renal might consent to let him hold her hand. M. de Renal talked politics in an angry tone: two or three manufactur- ers at Verrieres were becoming decidedly richer than himself, and wished to oppose him at the elections. Madame Derville listened to him. Julien, irritated by this talk, moved his chair nearer to Madame de Renal's. The darkness hid every movement. He ventured to place his hand close to the pretty arm which her gown left bare. Troubled, no longer conscious of what he was doing, he moved his cheek in the direc- tion of this pretty arm, and made bold to press his lips to it. Madame de Renal shuddered. Her husband was a few feet away, she hastened to give Julien her hand, at the same time thrusting him slightly from her. While M. de Renal continued his abuse of the good-for-noth- ings and Jacobins who were making fortunes, Julien covered the hand which had been left in his with passionate kisses, or so at least they seemed to Madame de Renal. And yet the poor woman had been fur- nished with proof, on this fatal day, that the heart of the man whom she adored without confessing it was pledged elsewhere! Throughout the hours of Julien's absence, she had been a prey to the most abject misery, which had made her think. 'What,' she said to herself, 'am I to love, to have love offered to me? Am I, a married woman, to fall in love? But,' she reminded herself, 'I have never felt that dark passion for my husband, and so I cannot tear my mind from Julien. At heart he is only a boy filled with respect for me! This folly will pass. How can it concern my husband what feelings I may entertain for this young man? M. de Renal would be bored by the talks I have with Julien, about things of the imagination. He himself thinks only about his business. I am taking nothing from him to give to Julien.' No trace of hypocrisy came to sully the purity of this simple soul, car- ried away by a passion such as she had never felt. She was deceived, but quite unawares, and at the same time a virtuous instinct had taken alarm. Such were the conflicts that were agitating her when Julien ap- peared in the garden. She heard his voice, almost at the same moment she saw him sit down by her side. Her heart was so to speak carried

away by this charming happiness which for the last fortnight had aston- ished even more than it had bewitched her. Everything was unexpected to her. And yet after a few moments: 'So Julien's presence is enough,' she said to herself, 'to wipe out all memory of his misconduct?' She took fright; then it was that she withdrew her hand from his. His kisses, filled with passion and such as she had never yet received, made her at once forget the possibility of his loving another woman. Soon he was no longer guilty in her eyes. The cessation of her poignant grief, born of suspicion, the presence of a happiness of which she had never even dreamed, plunged her in transports of affection and wild gaiety. That evening was delightful for them all, except for the Mayor of Verrieres, who could not forget the growing wealth of his competitors. Julien no longer thought of his dark ambition, nor of his plans that would be so difficult of execution. For the first time in his life, he was carried away by the power of beauty. Lost in a vague and pleasant dream, so foreign to his nature, gently pressing that hand which pleased him as an example of perfect beauty, he gave a divided attention to the rustle of the leaves of the lime, stirred by the gentle night breeze, and to the dogs at the mill by the Doubs, barking in the distance. But this emotion was a pleasure and not a passion. On returning to his room he thought of one happiness only, that of going on with his favour- ite book; at twenty, the thought of the world and of the impression one is going to make on it, prevails over everything else. Presently, however, he put down the book. By dint of dreaming of Napoleon's victories, he had discerned a new element in his own. 'Yes, I have won a battle,' he told himself, 'but I must follow it up, I must crush the arrogance of this proud gentleman while he is still retreating. That is Napoleon out and out. I must ask him for three days' holiday, to go and see my friend Fouque. If he refuses, I again offer to break the agreement; but he will give way.' Madame de Renal could not close an eye. She felt that she had never lived until that moment. She could not tear her mind from the happiness of feeling Julien cover her hand with burning kisses. Suddenly the horrid word adultery occurred to her. All the most dis- gusting implications that the vilest debauchery can impart to the idea of sensual love came crowding into her imagination. These ideas sought to tarnish the tender and godlike image that she had made for herself of Julien and of the pleasure of loving him. The future portrayed itself in terrible colours. She saw herself an object of scorn.

It was a frightful moment; her soul journeyed into strange lands. That evening she had tasted an unknown happiness; now she suddenly found herself plunged in appalling misery. She had no conception of such suf- ferings; they began to affect her reason. The thought occurred to her for a moment of confessing to her husband that she was afraid of falling in love with Julien. It would have allowed her to speak of him. Fortunately she recalled a piece of advice given her long ago by her aunt, on the eve of her marriage. It warned her of the danger of confiding in a husband, who is after all a master. In the intensity of her grief she wrung her hands. She was carried away indiscriminately by conflicting and painful ima- ginings. At one moment she was afraid of not being loved in return, at another the fearful thought of the crime tortured her as though on the morrow she would have to be exposed in the pillory, on the public square of Verrieres, with a placard proclaiming her adultery to the populace. Madame de Renal was without any experience of life; even when wide awake and in the full exercise of her reason, she would have seen no dis- tinction between being guilty in the sight of God and finding herself publicly greeted with all the most flagrant marks of general opprobrium. When the frightful idea of adultery and of all the ignominy which (she supposed) that crime brings in its train gave her at length a respite, and she began to dream of the delight of living with Julien innocently, as in the past, she found herself swept away by the horrible thought that Juli- en was in love with another woman. She saw once again his pallor when he was afraid of losing her portrait, or of compromising her by letting it be seen. For the first time, she had surprised signs of fear on that calm and noble countenance. Never had he shown himself in such a state for her or for her children. This additional grief carried her to the utmost in- tensity of anguish which the human soul is able to endure. Uncon- sciously, Madame de Renal uttered cries which roused her maid. Sud- denly she saw appear by her bedside the light of a lamp, and recognised Elisa. 'Is it you that he loves?' she cried in her frenzy. The maid, amazed at the fearful distress in which she found her mis- tress, paid no attention fortunately to this singular utterance. Madame de Renal realised her own imprudence: 'I am feverish,' she told her, 'and I think, a little light-headed; stay beside me.' Thoroughly awakened by the necessity of controlling herself, she felt less wretched; reason resumed the sway of which her state of drowsiness

had deprived it. To escape from the fixed stare of her maid, she ordered her to read the newspaper aloud, and it was to the monotonous sound of the girl's voice, reading a long article from the Quotidienne, that Madame de Renal formed the virtuous resolution to treat Julien with absolute coldness when next she saw him.

Chapter A Journey In Paris you find elegant people, there may be people with char- acter in the provinces. SIEYES Next morning, at five o'clock, before Madame de Renal was visible, Julien had obtained from her husband three days' leave of absence. Con- trary to his expectation, Julien found himself longing to see her again, and could think of nothing but that shapely hand. He went down to the garden, Madame de Renal was long in coming. But if Julien had been in love with her he would have seen her, behind her half-closed shutters on the first floor, her face pressed to the glass. She was watching him. At length, in spite of her resolutions, she decided to show herself in the garden. Her customary pallor had given place to the most glowing col- our. This simple-minded woman was evidently agitated: a feeling of con- straint and even of resentment marred that expression of profound serenity, as though raised above all the common interests of life, which gave such charm to that heavenly face. Julien lost no time in joining her; he admired those fine arms which a shawl flung in haste across her shoulders left visible. The coolness of the morning air seemed to increase the brilliance of a complexion which the agitation of the past night made all the more sensible to every impres- sion. This beauty, modest and touching, and yet full of thoughts which are nowhere to be found among the lower orders, seemed to reveal to Julien an aspect of her nature of which he had never yet been aware. Wholly absorbed in admiration of the charms which his greedy eye sur- prised, Julien was not thinking of the friendly greeting which he might expect to receive. He was all the more astonished by the icy coldness that was shown him, beneath which he even thought he could make out a de- liberate intention to put him in his place. The smile of pleasure faded from his lips; he remembered the rank that he occupied in society, especially in the eyes of a noble and wealthy

heiress. In a moment, his features showed nothing but pride and anger with himself. He felt a violent disgust at having been so foolish as to postpone his departure by more than an hour, only to receive so humili- ating a greeting. 'Only a fool,' he told himself, 'loses his temper with other people: a stone falls because it is heavy. Am I always to remain a boy? When am I going to form the good habit of giving these people their exact money's worth and no more of my heart and soul? If I wish to be esteemed by them and by myself, I must show them that it is my poverty that deals with their wealth, but that my heart is a thousand leagues away from their insolence, and is placed in too exalted a sphere to be reached by their petty marks of contempt or favour.' While these sentiments came crowding into the young tutor's mind, his features assumed an expression of injured pride and ferocity. Ma- dame de Renal was greatly distressed by this. The virtuous coldness which she had meant to impart to her greeting gave way to an expres- sion of interest, and of an interest animated by the surprise of the sudden change which she had just beheld in him. The flow of idle words that people exchange in the morning with regard to one another's health, to the beauty of the day, and so forth, dried up at once in them both. Julien, whose judgment was not disturbed by any passion, soon found a way of letting Madame de Renal see how little he regarded himself as being on terms of friendship with her; he said nothing to her of the little expedi- tion on which he was starting, bowed to her, and set off. As she watched him go, overwhelmed by the sombre pride which she read in that glance, so friendly the evening before, her eldest son, who came running up from the other end of the garden, said to her as he em- braced her: 'We have a holiday, M. Julien is going on a journey.' At these words Madame de Renal felt herself frozen by a deadly chill; she was unhappy in her virtue, and more unhappy still in her weakness. This latest development now occupied the whole of her imagination; she was carried far beyond the wise resolutions which were the fruit of the terrible night she had passed. It was a question no longer of resisting this charming lover, but of losing him for ever. She was obliged to take her place at table. To add to her misery, M. de Renal and Madame Derville spoke of nothing but Julien's departure. The Mayor of Verrieres had remarked something, unusual in the firm tone with which he had demanded a holiday.

'The young peasant has doubtless an offer from someone in his pocket. But that someone, even if it should be M. Valenod, must be a little dis- couraged by the sum of 600 francs, which he must now be prepared to spend annually. Yesterday, at Verrieres, he will have asked for three days in which to think things over; and this morning, so as not to be ob- liged to give me an answer, the young gentleman goes off to the moun- tains. To have to reckon with a wretched workman who puts on airs, that's what we've come to!' 'Since my husband, who does not know how deeply he has wounded Julien, thinks he is going to leave us, what am I to suppose?' Madame de Renal asked herself. 'Ah! It is all settled!' So as to be able at least to weep in freedom, and without having to an- swer Madame Derville's questions, she pleaded a splitting headache, and retired to bed. 'There you have a woman all over,' M. de Renal repeated; 'there's al- ways something wrong with those complicated machines.' And he went on his way jeering. While Madame de Renal was at the mercy of the most cruel inflictions of the terrible passion into which accident had led her, Julien was mak- ing his way light-heartedly amid the loveliest views that mountain scenery has to offer. He was obliged to pass over the high range to the north of Vergy. The path which he followed, rising gradually amid great beechwoods, forms an endless series of zigzags on the side of the high mountain which bounds the valley of the Doubs on the north. Presently the traveller's gaze, passing over the lower ridges which confine the course of the Doubs on the south, was able to sweep the fertile plains of Burgundy and Beaujolais. Irresponsive as the heart of this ambitious youth might be to this kind of beauty, he could not refrain from stopping now and again to gaze at so vast and so imposing a prospect. At length he came to the summit of the high mountain, beneath which he must pass in order to arrive, by this diagonal route, at the lonely val- ley in which his friend Fouque, the young timber merchant, lived. Julien was in no hurry to see him, or any other human being for that matter. Concealed like a bird of prey, amid the bare rocks which crowned the high mountain, he could see a long way off anyone that might be coming his way. He discovered a small cave in the almost perpendicular face of one of the rocks. He set his course for it, and presently was ensconced in this retreat. 'Here,' he said, his eyes sparkling with joy, 'men can do me no harm.' It occurred to him to indulge in the pleasure of writing down his thoughts, so dangerous to him in any other place. A smooth block of

stone served as his table. His pen flew: he saw nothing of the scene round about him. At length he noticed that the sun was setting behind the distant mountains of Beaujolais. 'Why should I not spend the night here?' he asked himself; 'I have bread, and I am free!' At the sound of that great word his heart leaped, his hypocrisy meant that he was not free even with Fouque. His head sup- ported on both his hands, Julien stayed in this cave happier than he had ever been in his life, engrossed in his dreams and in the joy of freedom. Without heeding it he saw fade and die, one after another, the last rays of evening light. In the midst of that vast darkness, his soul wandered in contemplation of what he imagined that he would one day find in Paris. This was first and foremost a woman far more beautiful and of a far higher intelligence than any it had been his lot to see in the country. He loved with passion, he was loved in return. If he tore himself from her for a few moments, it was to cover himself with glory and earn the right to be loved more warmly still. Even if we allow him Julien's imagination, a young man brought up among the melancholy truths of Paris would have been aroused at this stage in his romance by the cold touch of irony; the mighty deeds would have vanished with the hope of performing them, to give place to the well-known maxim: 'When a man leaves his mistress, he runs the risk of being betrayed two or three times daily.' The young peasant saw no obstacle between himself and the most heroic actions, save want of opportunity. But black night had succeeded the day, and he had still two leagues to cover before coming down to the hamlet in which Fouque lived. Before leaving the little cave, Julien struck a light and carefully destroyed all that he had written. He greatly astonished his friend by knocking at his door at one o'clock in the morning. He found Fouque engaged in making up his accounts. He was a young man of tall stature, none too well made, with large, hard features, a huge nose, and plenty of good nature concealed beneath this repellent aspect. 'You've quarrelled with your M. de Renal, then, that you come here of a sudden like this?' Julien related to him, with suitable omissions, the events of the previ- ous evening. 'Stay with me,' Fouque said to him; 'I see that you know M. de Renal, M. Valenod, the Sub-Prefect Maugiron, the cure Chelan; you have grasped all the subtle points of their natures; you're ripe now to put

yourself up for auction. You know arithmetic better than I do, you shall keep my books; I am making a big profit from my business. The im- possibility of doing everything by myself and the fear of hitting upon a rogue in the man I might take as my partner prevent me every day from doing the most profitable deals. Not a month ago I put six thousand francs in the pocket of Michaud of Saint-Amand, whom I had not seen for six years, and met quite by chance at the Pontarlier sale. Why should not you have made those six thousand francs yourself, or three thousand at least? For if I had had you with me that day, I should have gone on bidding for that lot of timber, and the other would soon have left me with it. Be my partner.' This offer annoyed Julien; it unsettled his erratic mind; throughout supper, which the friends cooked for themselves, like Homeric heroes, for Fouque lived by himself, he showed Julien his books, and proved to him what advantages his trade in timber offered. Fouque had the highest opinion of Julien's intelligence and character. When at length the latter found himself alone in his little room walled with planks of firwood, 'It is true,' he said to himself, 'I can make a few thousand francs here, then return with advantage to the calling of soldier or priest, according to the fashion prevailing in France at the time. The little hoard that I shall have amassed will remove all difficulties of detail. Alone on this mountainside, I can do something to dispel my present ap- palling ignorance of so many of the things that occupy the minds of all these fashionable gentlemen. But Fouque is giving up the thought of marriage, he has told me again and again that solitude is making him melancholy. It is obvious that if he is taking a partner who has no money to put into his business, it is in the hope of providing himself with a com- panion who will never leave him. 'Shall I prove false to my friend?' exclaimed Julien angrily. This creature, for whom hypocrisy and the absence of all fellow feeling were the ordinary line of conduct, could not on this occasion bear the thought of the slightest want of delicacy towards a man who loved him. But all at once Julien became happy, he had a reason for refusing. 'What, I should be idly wasting seven or eight years! I should thus arrive at eight and twenty; but, at that age, Napoleon had already done his greatest deeds! After I have obscurely scraped together a little money by going round all these timber sales, and winning the favour of various minor rascals, who can say whether I shall still preserve the sacred fire with which one makes oneself a name?'

The following morning, Julien replied with great coolness to the worthy Fouque, who looked upon the matter of their partnership as settled, that his vocation to the sacred ministry of the altar did not allow him to accept. Fouque could not believe his ears. 'But do you realise,' he kept on saying, 'that I make you my partner, or, if you prefer, give you four thousand francs a year? And you want to go back to your M. de Renal, who despises you like the mud on his shoes! When you have two hundred louis in hand, what is to prevent you from entering the Seminary? I will say more, I undertake to procure for you the best parish in the district. For,' Fouque went on, lowering his voice, 'I supply firewood to the ——, and the ——, and M. ——. I give them the best quality of oak, for which they pay me the price of white wood, but never was money better invested.' Nothing could prevail against Julien's vocation. In the end Fouque de- cided that he must be slightly mad. On the third day, at dawn, Julien left his friend to pass the day among the rocks of the big mountain. He found his little cave again, but he no longer enjoyed peace of mind, his friend's offers had destroyed it. Like Hercules he found himself called upon to choose not between vice and virtue, but between mediocrity ending in an assured comfort and all the heroic dreams of his youth. 'So I have no real firmness of character,' he told himself; and this was the doubt that pained him most. 'I am not of the stuff of which great men are made, since I am afraid that eight years spent in providing myself with bread may rob me of that sublime energy which makes men do ex- traordinary things.'

Chapter Open-work Stockings A novel is a mirror taken along a road. SAINT-REAL When Julien caught sight of the picturesque ruins of the old church of Vergy, it occurred to him that for two whole days he had not once thought of Madame de Renal. The other day, as I was leaving, that wo- man reminded me of the vast gulf that separates us, she treated me like a workman's son. No doubt she wished to show me that she repented of having let me hold her hand the night before ... It is a lovely hand, all the same! What charm, what nobility dwells in that woman's glance!' The possibility of making a fortune with Fouque gave a certain facility to the course of Julien's reasoning; it was less often interrupted by irrita- tion, and the keen sense of his own poverty and humble position in the eyes of the world. As though perched on a lofty promontory, he was able to judge, and, so to speak, overlooked extreme poverty on the one hand and that life of comfort which he still called riches on the other. He was far from considering his position like a philosopher, but he had sufficient perception to feel that he was different after this little expedition among the mountains. He was struck by the extreme uneasiness with which Madame de Ren- al listened to the short account of his journey, for which she had asked him. Fouque had had thoughts of marriage, unhappy love affairs; the con- versation between the friends had been filled with long confidences of this nature. After finding happiness too soon, Fouque had discovered that he was not the sole possessor of his mistress's heart. These disclos- ures had astonished Julien; he had learned much that was new to him. His solitary life, compounded of imagination and suspicion, had kept him aloof from everything that could have enlightened him.

During his absence, life had been for Madame de Renal nothing more than a succession of torments, each different but all alike intolerable; she was really ill. 'You must not, on any account,' Madame Derville told her when she saw Julien return, 'feeling as you do, sit in the garden this evening, the damp air would make you worse.' Madame Derville was surprised to see that her friend, who was al- ways being scolded by M. de Renal for the undue simplicity of her attire, had put on open-work stockings and a pair of charming little shoes that had arrived from Paris. For the last three days Madame de Renal's sole distraction had been to cut out and make Elisa put together in all haste a summer gown, of a charming little fabric greatly in fashion. It was just possible to finish this gown a few minutes after Julien's arrival; Madame de Renal at once put it on. Her friend had no longer any doubt. 'She is in love, poor woman!' Madame Derville said to herself. She un- derstood all the strange symptoms of her illness. She saw her speak to Julien. Pallor took the place of the most vivid blushes. Anxiety stood revealed in her eyes, fastened on those of the young tutor. Madame de Renal expected every moment that he was go- ing to offer an explanation, and announce that he was leaving the house, or would remain. It never occurred to Julien to say anything about this subject, which had not entered his thoughts. After a terrible struggle, Madame de Renal at last ventured to say to him, in a tremulous voice, in which the whole extent of her passion lay revealed: 'Are you going to leave your pupils to take a post elsewhere?' Julien was struck by her quavering voice and by the look in her eyes. 'This woman loves me,' he said to himself; 'but after this passing weak- ness for which her pride is reproaching her, and as soon as she is no longer afraid of my going, she will return to her arrogance.' This glimpse of their respective positions came to Julien like a flash of lightning; he replied, hesitatingly: 'I should greatly regret leaving such attractive and well-born children, but perhaps it will be inevitable. A man has duties towards himself also.' As he uttered the words well born (this was one of the aristocratic ex- pressions which Julien had recently acquired), he burned with a strong feeling of antipathy. 'To this woman,' he said to himself, 'I am not well born.' Madame de Renal, as she listened to him, was admiring his intelli- gence, his beauty, her heart was pierced by the possibility of departure which he dangled before her. All her friends from Verrieres who, during

Julien's absence, had come out to dine at Vergy, had almost vied in com- plimenting her upon the astonishing young man that her husband had had the good fortune to unearth. This was not to say that they under- stood anything of the progress that the children had made. The fact of his knowing the Bible by heart, and in Latin, too, had provoked in the in- habitants of Verrieres an admiration that will endure for, it may be, a century. Julien, who spoke to no one, knew nothing of all this. If Madame de Renal had had the slightest self-control, she would have congratulated him on the reputation he had won, and Julien, his pride set at rest, would have been pleasant and affable to her, all the more as her new gown seemed to him charming. Madame de Renal, also pleased with her pretty gown, and with what Julien said to her about it, had proposed a turn in the garden; soon she had confessed that she was not well enough to walk. She had taken the returned traveller's arm, and, far from restoring her strength, the contact of that arm deprived her of what little strength remained to her. It was dark; no sooner were they seated than Julien, relying on the privilege he had already won, ventured to press his lips to the arm of his pretty neighbour, and to take her hand. He was thinking of the boldness which Fouque had used with his mistresses, and not of Madame de Ren- al; the phrase well born still weighed upon his heart. His own hand was pressed, but this afforded him no pleasure. Far from his being proud, or even grateful for the affection which Madame de Renal betrayed this evening by unmistakable signs, beauty, elegance, freshness found him almost unconscious of their appeal. Purity of heart, freedom from any feeling of hatred, serve doubtless to prolong the duration of youth. It is the face that ages first in the majority of beautiful women. Julien was sullen all the evening; hitherto he had been angry only with fortune and with society; now that Fouque had offered him an ignoble way of arriving at comfort, he was angry with himself. Absorbed in his own thoughts, although now and then he addressed a few words to the ladies, Julien ended by unconsciously letting go Madame de Renal's hand. This action completely nonplussed the poor woman; she saw in it an indication of her fate. Had she been certain of Julien's affection, her virtue might perhaps have found strength to resist him. Trembling at the thought of losing him for ever, her passion carried her to the point of seizing Julien's hand, which, in his distraction, he had allowed to rest upon the back of a chair. This action stirred the ambitious youth; he would have liked it to be

witnessed by all those proud nobles who, at table, when he was at the lower end with the children, used to look at him with so patronising a smile. 'This woman cannot despise me any longer: in that case,' he said to himself, 'I ought to be stirred by her beauty; I owe it to myself to be her lover.' Such an idea would never have occurred to him before he re- ceived the artless confidences of his friend. The sudden resolution he had just made formed a pleasing distraction. He said to himself: 'I must have one of these two women'; he realised that he would greatly have preferred to pay his court to Madame Derville; it was not that she was more attractive, but she had seen him al- ways as a tutor honoured for his learning, and not as a working car- penter, with a ratteen jacket folded under his arm, as he had first ap- peared to Madame de Renal. It was precisely as a young workman, blushing to the whites of his eyes, hesitating outside the door of the house and not venturing to ring the bell, that Madame de Renal delighted most to picture him. As he followed up this survey of his position, Julien saw that he must not think of attempting the conquest of Madame Derville, who had prob- ably noticed the weakness that Madame de Renal showed for him. Forced to return to the latter: 'What do I know of this woman's charac- ter?' Julien asked himself. 'Only this: before I went away, I took her hand, she withdrew it; today I withdraw my hand, she seizes it and presses it. A good opportunity to repay her all the contempt she has shown for me. God knows how many lovers she has had! Perhaps she is deciding in my favour only because of the facilities for our meeting.' Such is, alas, the drawback of an excessive civilisation. At the age of twenty, the heart of a young man, if he has any education, is a thousand leagues from that devil-may-care attitude without which love is often only the most tedious duty. 'I owe it to myself all the more,' went on Julien's petty vanity, 'to suc- ceed with this woman, so that if I ever make my fortune, and someone reproaches me with having filled the humble post of tutor, I may let it be understood that it was love that brought me into that position.' Julien once more withdrew his hand from that of Madame de Renal, then took her hand again and pressed it. As they returned to the drawing-room, towards midnight, Madame de Renal murmured in his ear: 'Are you leaving us, are you going away?' Julien answered with a sigh:

'I must indeed go away, for I love you passionately; it is a sin ... and what a sin for a young priest!' Madame de Renal leaned upon his arm, bending towards him until her cheek felt the warmth of his. The night passed for these two people very differently. Madame de Renal was exalted by transports of the most lofty moral pleasure. A coquettish girl who falls in love early grows accustomed to the distress of love; when she comes to the age of true passion, the charm of novelty is lacking. As Madame de Renal had never read any novels, all the re- finements of her happiness were new to her. No melancholy truth came to freeze her heart, not even the spectre of the future. She saw herself as happy in ten years' time as she was at that moment. Even the thought of virtue and of the fidelity she had vowed to M. de Renal, which had dis- tressed her some days before, presented itself in vain, she dismissed it like an importunate stranger. 'Never will I allow Julien to take any liberty,' Madame de Renal told herself, 'we shall live in future as we have been living for the last month. He shall be a friend.'

Chapter The English Scissors A girl of sixteen had a rosy complexion, and put on rouge. POLIDORI As for Julien, Fouque's offer had indeed destroyed all his happiness; he could not decide upon any course. 'Alas! Perhaps I am wanting in character, I should have made Napo- leon a bad soldier. Anyhow,' he went on, 'my little intrigue with the lady of the house is going to distract me for the moment.' Fortunately for him, even in this minor incident, his inward feelings bore no relation to his cavalier language. He was afraid of Madame de Renal because of her pretty gown. This gown was in his eyes the ad- vance guard of Paris. His pride was determined to leave nothing to chance and to the inspiration of the moment. Drawing upon Fouque's confessions and the little he had read about love in the Bible, he pre- pared a plan of campaign in great detail. Since, though he did not admit it to himself, he was extremely anxious, he committed this plan to writing. The following morning, in the drawing-room, Madame de Renal was alone with him for a moment. 'Have you no other name besides Julien?' she asked him. Our hero did not know what answer to give to so flattering a question. No provision had been made in his plan for such an event. But for the stupid mistake of making a plan, Julien's quick mind would soon have come to his rescue, his surprise would only have added to the keenness of his perceptions. He was awkward and exaggerated his own awkwardness. Madame de Renal soon forgave him that. She saw in it the effect of a charming cand- our. And the one thing lacking, to her mind, in this man, who was con- sidered so brilliant, was an air of candour.

'I don't at all trust your little tutor,' Madame Derville said to her on several occasions. 'He seems to me to be always thinking and to act only from motives of policy. He's crafty.' Julien remained deeply humiliated by the disaster of not having known what answer to make to Madame de Renal. 'A man of my sort owes it to himself to make up for this check'; and, seizing the moment at which she passed from one room to another, he did what he considered his duty by giving Madame de Renal a kiss. Nothing could have been less appropriate, less agreeable either to him- self or to her, nor could anything have been more imprudent. They barely escaped being caught. Madame de Renal thought him mad. She was frightened and even more shocked. This stupidity reminded her of M. Valenod. 'What would happen to me,' she asked herself, 'if I were left alone with him?' All her virtue returned, for her love was in eclipse. She arranged matters so that there should always be one of her chil- dren with her. The day passed slowly for Julien, he spent the whole of it in clumsily carrying out his plan of seduction. He never once looked at Madame de Renal without embodying a question in his look; he was not, however, such a fool as not to see that he was failing completely to be agreeable, let alone seductive. Madame de Renal could not get over her astonishment at finding him so awkward and at the same time so bold. 'It is the timidity of love in a man of parts!' she said to herself at length, with an inexpressible joy. 'Can it be possible that he has never been loved by my rival!' After luncheon, Madame de Renal returned to the drawing-room to entertain M. Charcot de Maugiron, the Sub-Prefect of Bray. She was working at a little tapestry frame on a tall stand. Madame Derville was by her side. It was in this position, and in the full light of day, that our hero thought fit to thrust forward his boot and press the pretty foot of Madame de Renal, whose open-work stocking and smart Parisian shoe were evidently attracting the gaze of the gallant Sub-Prefect. Madame de Renal was extremely alarmed; she let fall her scissors, her ball of wool, her needles, and Julien's movement could thus pass for a clumsy attempt to prevent the fall of the scissors, which he had seen slip- ping down. Fortunately these little scissors of English steel broke, and Madame de Renal could not sufficiently express her regret that Julien had not been nearer at hand.

'You saw them falling before I did, you might have caught them; your zeal has only succeeded in giving me a violent kick.' All this play-acting took in the Sub-Prefect, but not Madame Derville. 'This pretty youth has very bad manners!' she thought; the worldly-wis- dom of a provincial capital can never pardon mistakes of this sort. Ma- dame de Renal found an opportunity of saying to Julien: 'Be careful, I order you.' Julien realised his own clumsiness, and was annoyed. For a long time he debated within himself whether he ought to take offence at the words: 'I order you.' He was foolish enough to think: 'She might say to me "I or- der you" if it was something to do with the children's education; but in responding to my love, she assumes equality. One cannot love without equality'; and he lost himself in composing commonplaces on the subject of equality. He repeated angrily to himself the verse of Corneille which Madame Derville had taught him a few days earlier: Love creates equalities, it does not seek them. Julien, insisting upon playing the part of a Don Juan, he who had nev- er had a mistress in his life, was deadly dull for the rest of the day. He had only one sensible idea; bored with himself and with Madame de Renal, he saw with alarm the evening approach when he would be seated in the garden, by her side and in the dark. He told M. de Renal that he was going to Verrieres to see the cure; he set off after dinner, and did not return until late at night. At Verrieres, Julien found M. Chelan engaged in packing up; he had at last been deprived of his benefice; the vicar Maslon was to succeed him. Julien helped the good cure, and it occurred to him to write to Fouque that the irresistible vocation which he felt for the sacred ministry had prevented him at first from accepting his friend's obliging offer, but that he had just witnessed such an example of injustice, that perhaps it would be more advantageous to his welfare were he not to take holy orders. Julien applauded his own deftness in making use of the deprivation of the cure of Verrieres to leave a door open for himself and so return to commerce, should the sad voice of prudence prevail, in his mind, over heroism.

Chapter Cock-crow Amour en latin faict amor; Or done provient d'amour la mort, Et, par avant, soulcy qui mord, Deuil, plours, pieges, forfaitz, remord ... Blason d'amour If Julien had had a little of that discernment which he so gratuitously supposed himself to possess, he might have congratulated himself next day on the effect produced by his visit to Verrieres. His absence had caused his clumsiness to be forgotten. All that day too, he was inclined to sulk; towards nightfall a preposterous idea occurred to him, and he im- parted it to Madame de Renal with a rare intrepidity. No sooner had they sat down in the garden than, without waiting for a sufficient cloak of darkness, Julien put his lips to Madame de Renal's ear, and, at the risk of compromising her horribly, said to her: 'Tonight, Ma'am, at two o'clock, I am coming to your room, I have something to say to you.' Julien was trembling lest his request should be granted; the part of a seducer was so horrible a burden that if he had been free to follow his own inclination, he would have retired to his room for some days, and not set eyes on the ladies again. He realised that, by his clever tactics of yesterday, he had squandered all the promise of the day before, and really he did not know where to turn. Madame de Renal replied with a genuine and by no means exagger- ated indignation to the impertinent announcement which Julien had had the audacity to make. He thought he could read scorn in her brief an- swer. It was certain that in this answer, uttered in the lowest of tones, the word 'Fie!' had figured. Making the excuse that he had something to say to the children, Julien went up to their room, and on his return placed himself by the side of Madame Derville and at a distance from Madame de Renal. He thus removed from himself all possibility of taking her hand. The conversation took a serious turn, and Julien held his own

admirably, apart from a few intervals of silence during which he cudgelled his brains. 'Why cannot I think of some fine plan,' he asked himself, 'to force Madame de Renal to show me those unmistakable marks of affection which made me imagine, three days ago, that she was mine!' Julien was extremely disconcerted by the almost desperate situation into which he had been led. And yet nothing could have embarrassed him so much as success. When the party broke up at midnight, his pessimism led him to be- lieve that Madame Derville looked upon him with contempt, and that probably he stood no higher in the favour of Madame de Renal. Being in an extremely bad temper and deeply humiliated, Julien could not sleep. He was a thousand leagues from any thought of abandoning all pretence, all his plans, and of living from day to day with Madame de Renal, contenting himself like a child with the happiness that each day would bring. He wearied his brain in devising clever stratagems; a moment later, he felt them to be absurd; he was in short extremely wretched, when two struck from the clock tower. This sound aroused him as the crow of the cock aroused Saint Peter. He saw himself arrived at the moment of the most distressing event. He had not thought once again of his impertinent suggestion, from the mo- ment in which he had made it. It had met with so hostile a reception! 'I told her that I should come to her at two o'clock,' he said to himself as he rose; 'I may be inexperienced and coarse, as is natural in the son of a peasant, Madame Derville has let me see that plainly enough; but at any rate I will not be weak.' Julien had every right to praise his own courage, never had he set him- self a more painful task. As he opened the door of his room, he trembled so much that his knees gave way beneath him, and he was obliged to lean against the wall. He was in his stockinged feet. He went to listen at M. de Renal's door, through which he could hear him snoring. This dismayed him. He had no longer any excuse for not going to her. But, great God! What should he do when he got there? He had no plan, and even if he had had one, he was in such distress of mind that he would not have been in a fit state to put it into practice. Finally, with an anguish a thousand times keener than if he had been going to the scaffold, he entered the little corridor that led to Madame de

Renal's room. He opened the door with a trembling hand, making a fear- ful noise as he did so. There was a light in the room, a night light was burning in the fire- place; he had not expected this fresh calamity. Seeing him enter, Ma- dame de Renal sprang quickly out of bed. 'Wretch!' she cried. There was some confusion. Julien forgot his futile plans and returned to his own natural character. Not to please so charming a woman seemed to him the greatest disaster possible. His only answer to her reproaches was to fling himself at her feet, clasping her round the knees. As she spoke to him with extreme harshness, he burst into tears. Some hours later, when Julien emerged from Madame de Renal's room, one might have said, in the language of romance, that there was nothing more left for him to wish. And indeed, he was indebted to the love he had inspired and to the unforeseen impression made on him by her seductive charms for a victory to which not all his misplaced ingenu- ity would ever have led him. But, in the most delicious moments, the victim of a freakish pride, he still attempted to play the part of a man in the habit of captivating wo- men: he made incredible efforts to destroy his natural amiability. Instead of his paying attention to the transports which he excited, and to the re- morse that increased their vivacity, the idea of duty was continually be- fore his eyes. He feared a terrible remorse, and undying ridicule, should he depart from the ideal plan that he had set himself to follow. In a word, what made Julien a superior being was precisely what prevented him from enjoying the happiness that sprang up at his feet. He was like a girl of sixteen who has a charming complexion and, before going to a ball, is foolish enough to put on rouge. In mortal terror at the apparition of Julien, Madame de Renal was soon a prey to the cruellest alarms. Julien's tears and despair distressed her greatly. Indeed, when she had no longer anything to refuse him, she thrust him from her, with genuine indignation, and then flung herself into his arms. No purpose was apparent in all this behaviour. She thought her- self damned without remission, and sought to shut out the vision of hell by showering the most passionate caresses on Julien. In a word, nothing would have been wanting to complete our hero's happiness, not even a burning sensibility in the woman he had just vanquished, had he been capable of enjoying it. Julien's departure brought no cessation of the transports which were shaking her in spite of herself, nor of her struggle with the remorse that was tearing her.

'Heavens! Is to be happy, to be loved, no more than that?' Such was Julien's first thought on his return to his own room. He was in that state of astonishment and uneasy misgivings into which a heart falls when it has just obtained what it has long desired. It has grown used to desiring, finds nothing left to desire, and has not yet acquired any memories. Like a soldier returning from a parade, Julien was busily engaged in review- ing all the details of his conduct. 'Have I failed in one of the duties I owe to myself? Have I really played my part?' And what a part! The part of a man accustomed to shine before women.

Chapter The Day After He turn'd his lips to hers, and with his hand Call'd back the tangles of her wandering hair. Don Juan, I. 170 Fortunately for Julien's pride, Madame de Renal had been too greatly agitated and surprised to notice the fatuity of the man who in a moment had become everything in the world to her. As she was imploring him to withdraw, seeing the day begin to break: 'Oh, Heavens!' she said, 'if my husband has heard any sound, I am lost.' Julien, who had leisure for composing phrases, remembered one to the point: 'Should you regret your life?' 'Ah! Very much at this moment, but I should not regret having known you.' Julien found that his dignity required him to return to his room in broad daylight and with deliberate want of precaution. The continuous attention with which he watched his own slightest ac- tions, in the insane idea of being taken for a man of experience, had this one advantage; when he saw Madame de Renal again, at luncheon, his behaviour was a miracle of prudence. As for her, she could not look at him without blushing to the whites of her eyes, and could not live for an instant without looking at him; she noticed her own confusion, and her efforts to conceal it increased. Julien raised his eyes to hers once only. At first, Madame de Renal admired his prudence. Presently, seeing that this solitary glance was not repeated, she took alarm: 'Can it be that he does not love me any more,' she asked herself; 'alas, I am far too old for him; I am ten years his senior.' On the way from the dining-room to the garden, she pressed Julien's hand. In the surprise that he felt at so extraordinary a token of affection, he gazed at her with passion; for she had struck him as looking very

pretty at luncheon, and, without raising his eyes, he had spent his time making a detailed catalogue of her charms. This look consoled Madame de Renal; it did not remove all her uneasiness; but her uneasiness re- moved, almost entirely, the remorse she felt when she thought of her husband. At luncheon, the said husband had noticed nothing; not so with Ma- dame Derville; she feared Madame de Renal to be on the point of suc- cumbing. All through the day, her bold, incisive friendship did not spare the other those hinted suggestions intended to portray in hideous col- ours the danger that she was running. Madame de Renal was burning to be left alone with Julien; she wanted to ask him whether he still loved her. Despite the unalterable gentleness of her nature, she was more than once on the point of letting her friend know what a nuisance she was making of herself. That evening, in the garden, Madame Derville arranged things so skil- fully that she found herself placed between Madame de Renal and Juli- en. Madame de Renal, who had formed a delicious image of the pleasure of pressing Julien's hand and carrying it to her lips, could not so much as address a word to him. This catastrophe increased her agitation. Remorse for one thing was gnawing her. She had so scolded Julien for the imprudence he had shown in coming to her room the night before, that she trembled lest he might not come that night. She left the garden early, and went up to wait in her room. But, beside herself with impatience, she rose and went to glue her ear to Julien's door. Despite the uncertainty and passion that were devouring her, she did not dare enter. This action seemed to her the last word in lowness, for it serves as text to a country maxim. The servants were not all in bed. Prudence obliged her finally to return to her own room. Two hours of waiting were two centuries of torment. But Julien was too loyal to what he called his duty, to fail in the execu- tion, detail by detail, of what he had laid down for himself. As one o'clock struck, he slipped quietly from his room, made sure that the master of the house was sound asleep, and appeared before Ma- dame de Renal. On this occasion he found greater happiness with his mistress, for he was less continually thinking of the part he had to play. He had eyes to see and ears to hear. What Madame de Renal said to him about his age contributed to give him some degree of self-assurance. 'Alas! I am ten years older than you! How can you love me?' she re- peated without any object, simply because the idea oppressed her.

Julien could not conceive such a thing, but he saw that her distress was genuine, and almost entirely forgot his fear of being ridiculous. The foolish idea of his being regarded as a servile lover, at his mistress's beck and call, on account of his humble birth, vanished like- wise. In proportion as Julien's transports reassured his coy mistress, she recovered some degree of happiness and the faculty of criticising her lov- er. Fortunately, he showed almost nothing, on this occasion, of that bor- rowed air which had made their meeting the night before a victory, but not a pleasure. Had she noticed his intentness upon playing a part, the painful discovery would have robbed her of all happiness for ever. She could have seen in it nothing else than a painful consequence of their dis- parity of age. Albeit Madame de Renal had never thought about theories of love, dif- ference of age is, next to difference of fortune, one of the great common- places of provincial humour, whenever there is any talk of love. In a few days, Julien, all the ardour of his youth restored, was madly in love. 'One must admit,' he said to himself, 'that her kindness of heart is an- gelic, and that no one could be prettier.' He had almost entirely lost the idea of a part to be played. In a mo- ment of unrestrained impulse, he even confessed to her all his anxieties. This confidence raised to its climax the passion that he inspired. 'So I have not had any fortunate rival,' Madame de Renal said to herself with ecstasy. She ventured to question him as to the portrait in which he took such an interest; Julien swore to her that it was that of a man. When Madame de Renal was calm enough to reflect, she could not get over her astonishment that such happiness could exist and that she had never had the slightest idea of it. 'Ah!' she said to herself, 'if I had known Julien ten years ago, when I might still be considered pretty!' Julien's thoughts were worlds apart from these. His love was still founded in ambition: it was the joy of possessing—he, a poor creature so unfortunate and so despised—so noble and beautiful a woman. His acts of adoration, his transports at the sight of his mistress's charms, ended by reassuring her somewhat as to the difference in age. Had she pos- sessed a little of that worldly wisdom a woman of thirty has long en- joyed in more civilised lands, she would have shuddered for the continu- ance of a love which seemed to exist only upon surprise and the titilla- tion of self-esteem.

In the moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien went into trans- ports over everything that Madame de Renal possessed, including her hats and gowns. He could not tire of the pleasure of inhaling their per- fume. He opened her wardrobe and stood for hours on end marvelling at the beauty and neat arrangement of everything inside. His mistress, leaning upon his shoulder, gazed at him; he himself gazed at those orna- ments and fripperies which on a wedding day are displayed among the presents. 'I might have married a man like this!' Madame de Renal sometimes thought; 'What a fiery spirit! What a rapturous life with him!' As for Julien, never had he found himself so close to those terrible weapons of feminine artillery. 'It is impossible,' he told himself, 'that in Paris there can be anything finer!' After which he could find no objection to his happiness. Often his mistress's sincere admiration, and her trans- ports of passion made him forget the fatuous theory that had kept him so restrained and almost ridiculous in the first moments of their intimacy. There were moments when, despite his hypocritical habits, he found an intense pleasure in confessing to this great lady who admired him his ig- norance of any number of little usages. His mistress's rank seemed to raise him above himself. Madame de Renal, for her part, found the most exquisite moral satisfaction in thus instructing in a heap of little things this young man endowed with genius whom everyone regarded as bound one day to go so far. Even the Sub-Prefect and M. Valenod could not help admiring him: she thought the better of them accordingly. As for Madame Derville, these were by no means her sentiments. In despair at what she thought she could discern, and seeing that her wise counsel was becoming hateful to a woman who had positively lost her head, she left Vergy without offering an explanation for which she was not asked. Madame de Renal shed a few tears at her departure, and soon it seemed to her that her happiness was doubled. By the withdrawal of her guest she found herself left alone with her lover almost all day long. Julien gave himself all the more readily to the pleasant society of his mistress inasmuch as, whenever he was left too long by himself, Fouque's fatal offer recurred to his mind to worry him. In the first days of this new life, there were moments when he, who had never loved, who had never been loved by anyone, found so exquisite a pleasure in being sincere, that he was on the point of confessing to Madame de Ren- al the ambition which until then had been the very essence of his exist- ence. He would have liked to be able to consult her as to the strange

temptation which he felt in Fouque's offer, but a trifling occurrence put a stop to all frankness.

Chapter The Principal Deputy O! how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day, Which now shows all the beauty of the sun, And by and by a cloud takes all away! The Two Gentlemen of Verona One evening as the sun set, sitting by his mistress, at the end of the orchard, safe from disturbance, he was deep in thought. 'Will such deli- cious moments,' he was wondering, 'last for ever?' His thoughts were ab- sorbed in the difficulty of adopting a profession, he was deploring this great and distressing problem which puts an end to boyhood and spoils the opening years of manhood when one has no money. 'Ah!' he cried, 'Napoleon was indeed the man sent by God to help the youth of France! Who is to take his place? What will the poor wretches do without him, even those who are richer than I, who have just the few crowns needed to procure them a good education, and not enough money to purchase a man at twenty and launch themselves in a career! Whatever happens,' he added with deep sigh, 'that fatal memory will for ever prevent us from being happy!' He saw Madame de Renal frown suddenly; she assumed a cold, dis- dainful air; this line of thought seemed to her worthy of a servant. Brought up in the idea that she was extremely rich, it seemed to her a thing to be taken for granted that Julien was also. She loved him a thou- sand times more than life itself, and money to her meant nothing. Julien was far from guessing what was in her mind. This frown brought him back to earth. He had presence of mind enough to arrange his sentence and to make it plain to the noble lady, seated so close beside him on the bank of verdure, that the words he had just uttered were some that he had heard during his expedition to his friend the timber merchant. This was the reasoning of the impious.

'Very well! Don't mix any more with such people,' said Madame de Renal, still preserving a trace of that glacial air which had suddenly taken the place of an expression of the tenderest affection. This frown, or rather his remorse for his imprudence, was the first check administered to the illusion that was bearing Julien away. He said to himself: 'She is good and kind, her feeling for me is strong, but she has been brought up in the enemy's camp. They are bound to be specially afraid of that class of men of spirit who, after a good education, have not enough money to enter upon a career. What would become of these nobles, if it were granted us to fight them with equal weapons? Myself, for instance, as Mayor of Verrieres, well intentioned, honest as M. de Renal is at heart, how I should deal with the vicar, M. Valenod and all their rascalities! How justice should triumph in Verrieres. It is not their talents that would prove an obstacle. They are endlessly feeling their way.' Julien's happiness was, that day, on the point of becoming permanent. What our hero lacked was the courage to be sincere. He needed the cour- age to give battle, but on the spot; Madame de Renal had been surprised by his speech, because the men whom she was in the habit of meeting were always saying that the return of Robespierre was made possible es- pecially by these young men of the lower orders, who had been too well educated. Madame de Renal's cold manner persisted for some time, and seemed to Julien to be marked. This was because the fear of having said to him indirectly something unpleasant followed her repugnance at his unfortunate speech. This distress was clearly shown on her pure coun- tenance; so simple when she was happy and away from bores. Julien no longer dared give himself up freely to his dreams. More calm and less amorous, he decided that it was imprudent in him to go to Ma- dame de Renal in her room. It would be better if she came to him; if a servant saw her moving about the house, there would be a score of pos- sible reasons to account for her action. But this arrangement also had its drawbacks. Julien had received from Fouque certain books for which he, as a student of divinity, could never have asked a bookseller. He ventured to open them only at night. Often he would have been just as well pleased not to be interrupted by an as- signation, the tension of waiting for which, even before the little scene in the orchard, would have left him incapable of reading. He was indebted to Madame de Renal for an entirely new understand- ing of the books he read. He had ventured to ply her with questions as to all sorts of little things ignorance of which seriously handicaps the

intelligence of a young man born outside the ranks of society, whatever natural genius one may choose to attribute to him. This education in love, given by an extremely ignorant woman, was a blessing. Julien was at once enabled to see society as it is today. His mind was not perplexed by accounts of what it was in the past, two thousand years ago, or sixty years ago merely, in the days of Voltaire and Louis XV. To his unspeakable joy a cloud passed from before his eyes; he un- derstood at last the things that were happening at Verrieres. In the foreground appeared the highly complicated intrigues woven, for the last two years, round the Prefect at Besancon. They were suppor- ted by letters that came from Paris, and bore all the most illustrious sig- natures. It was a question of making M. de Moirod, the most bigoted man in the place, the Principal instead of the Second Deputy to the May- or of Verrieres. His rival was an extremely rich manufacturer, whom it was absolutely essential to confine to the post of Second Deputy. Julien at last understood the hints that he had overheard, when the cream of local society came to dine with M. de Renal. This privileged class was greatly taken up with this selection of a Principal Deputy, of which the rest of the town and especially the Liberals did not even sus- pect the possibility. What gave it its importance was that, as everybody knew, the eastern side of the main street of Verrieres must be moved back more than nine feet, for this street was now a royal highway. Well, if M. de Moirod, who owned three houses that would have to be moved back, succeeded in becoming Principal Deputy, and so Mayor in the event of M. de Renal's being returned to Parliament, he would shut his eyes, and it would be possible to make little, imperceptible repairs to the houses that encroached on the public thoroughfare, as a result of which they would be good for a hundred years. Despite the great piety and admitted probity of M. de Moirod, it was certain that he could be managed, for he had a large family. Among the houses that would have to be moved back, nine belonged to the very best people in Verrieres. In Julien's eyes, this intrigue was far more important than the history of the battle of Fontenoy, a name which he saw for the first time in one of the books that Fouque had sent him. Many things had astonished Julien during the five years since he had begun to spend his evenings with the cure. But discretion and a humble spirit being the chief qualities required in a divinity student, it had always been impossible for him to ask any questions.

One day, Madame de Renal had given an order to her husband's valet, Julien's enemy. 'But, Ma'am, today is the last Friday of the month,' the man answered her with a curious expression. 'Go,' said Madame de Renal. 'Well,' said Julien, 'he is going to that hay store, which used to be a church, and was recently restored to the faith; but why? That is one of the mysteries which I have never been able to penetrate.' 'It is a most beneficial, but a very strange institution,' replied Madame de Renal. 'Women are not admitted; all that I know of it is that they all address one another as tu. For instance, this servant will find M. Valenod there, and that conceited fool will not be in the least annoyed at hearing himself called tu by Saint-Jean, and will answer him in the same tone. If you really want to know what they do there, I can ask M. de Maugiron and M. Valenod for details. We pay twenty francs for each servant so that they do not cut our throats.' The time flew. The memory of his mistress's charms distracted Julien from his black ambition. The necessity to refrain from speaking to her of serious, reasonable matters, since they were on opposite sides, added, without his suspecting it, to the happiness that he owed to her and to the power which she was acquiring over him. At those moments when the presence of quick-eared children confined them to the language of cold reason, it was with a perfect docility that Julien, gazing at her with eyes that burned with love, listened to her ex- planations of the world as it really was. Often, in the middle of an ac- count of some clever piece of roguery, in connection with the laying out of a road, or of some astounding contract, Madame de Renal's mind would suddenly wander to the point of delirium; Julien was obliged to scold her, she allowed herself to caress him in the same way as she caressed her children. This was because there were days on which she imagined that she loved him like a child of her own. Had she not to reply incessantly to his artless questions about a thousand simple matters of which a child of good family is not ignorant at fifteen? A moment later, she was admiring him as her master. His intelligence positively frightened her; she thought she could perceive more clearly every day the future great man in this young cleric. She saw him as Pope, she saw him as First Minister, like Richelieu. 'Shall I live long enough to see you in your glory?' she said to Julien; 'there is a place waiting for a great man; the Monarchy, the Church need

one; these gentlemen say so every day. If some Richelieu does not stem the torrent of private judgment, all is lost.'

Chapter A King at Verrieres Are you fit only to be flung down like the corpse of a nation, its soul gone and its veins emptied of blood? (From the Bishop's address, delivered in the Chapel of Saint Clement) On the third of September, at ten o'clock in the evening, a mounted constable aroused the whole of Verrieres by galloping up the main street; he brought the news that His Majesty the King of — was coming the fol- lowing Sunday, and it was now Tuesday. The Prefect authorised, that is to say ordered, the formation of a Guard of Honour; he must be received with all the pomp possible. A courier was sent to Vergy. M. de Renal ar- rived during the night and found the whole town in a ferment. Every- body was claiming a right to something; those who had no other duty were engaging balconies to see the King enter the town. Who was to command the Guard of Honour? M. de Renal saw at once how important it was, in the interest of the houses that would have to be moved back, that M. de Moirod should fill this post. It might be held to constitute a claim to the place of Principal Deputy. There was nothing to be said against M. de Moirod's devotion; it went beyond all comparison, but he had never ridden a horse in his life. He was a man of six and thirty, timid in every way, and equally afraid of falls and of being laughed at. The Mayor sent for him at five o'clock in the morning. 'You see, Sir, that I am asking your advice, as though you already oc- cupied the post in which all right-minded people would gladly see you. In this unfortunate town the manufacturers prosper, the Liberal Party are becoming millionaires, they aspire to power, they will forge them- selves weapons out of everything. We must consider the King's interests, those of the Monarchy, and above all those of our holy religion. To whom do you think, Sir, that we ought to entrust the command of the Guard of Honour?'

In spite of the horrible fear that a horse inspired in him, M. de Moirod ended by accepting this honour like a martyr. 'I shall manage to adopt the right manner,' he told the Mayor. There was barely time to overhaul the uniforms which had been used seven years before on the passage of a Prince of the Blood. At seven, Madame de Renal arrived from Vergy with Julien and the children. She found her drawing-room full of Liberal ladies who were preaching the union of parties, and had come to implore her to make her husband find room in the Guard of Honour for theirs. One of them asser- ted that if her husband were not chosen he would go bankrupt from grief. Madame de Renal sent them all packing at once. She seemed greatly occupied. Julien was surprised and even more annoyed by her making a mystery to him of what was disturbing her. 'I thought as much,' he told himself bitterly, 'her love is eclipsed by the joy of receiving a King in her house. All this excitement dazzles her. She will begin to love me again when her brain is no longer troubled by ideas of caste.' The surprising thing was that he loved her all the more for this. The upholsterers began to invade the whole house, he long watched in vain for an opportunity of saying a word to her. At length he found her coming out of his own room, carrying one of his coats. They were alone. He tried to speak to her. She made off, declining to listen to him. 'What a fool I am to be in love with a woman like that, ambition makes her just as stupid as her husband.' She was even more so: one of her great wishes, which she had never confessed to Julien, for fear of shocking him, was to see him discard, if only for a day, his gloomy black coat. With an ingenuity truly admirable in so natural a woman, she secured, first from M. de Moirod, and then from the Sub-Prefect M. de Maugiron, that Julien should be appointed to the Guard of Honour in preference to five or six young men, sons of manufacturers in easy circumstances, at least two of whom were of an exemplary piety. M. Valenod, who was reckoning on lending his car- riage to the prettiest women of the town, in order to have his fine Nor- man horses admired, agreed to let Julien, the person he hated most, have one of them. But each of the members of the Guard of Honour possessed or had borrowed one of those sky-blue coats with a pair of colonel's epaulettes in silver, which had shone in public seven years before. Ma- dame de Renal wanted a new coat, and she had but four days in which to send to Besancon, and to procure from there the uniform, the weapons, the hat, and all the other requisites for a Guard of Honour.

What is rather amusing is that she thought it imprudent to have Julien's coat made at Verrieres. She wished to take him by surprise, him and the town. The work of organising the Guard of Honour and popular feeling fin- ished, the Mayor had next to deal with a great religious ceremony; the King of —— refused to pass through Verrieres without paying a visit to the famous relic of Saint Clement which is preserved at Bray-le-Haut, a short league from the town. The clergy must be present in full force, and this was the most difficult thing to arrange; M. Maslon, the new cure, was determined, at any price, to keep M. Chelan out. In vain did M. de Renal point out to him the imprudence of this action. The Marquis de La Mole, whose ancestors for so long were Governors of the Province, had been chosen to accompany the King of ——. He had known the abbe Chelan for thirty years. He would be certain to inquire for him on arriv- ing at Verrieres, and, if he found that he was in disgrace, was quite cap- able of going in search of him, to the little house to which he had retired, accompanied by such of the procession as were under his orders. What a rebuff that would be! 'I am dishonoured here and at Besancon,' replied the abbe Maslon, 'if he appears among my clergy. A Jansenist, great heavens!' 'Whatever you may say, my dear abbe,' M. de Renal assured him, 'I shall not expose the municipal government of Verrieres to the risk of an insult from M. de La Mole. You don't know the man, he is sound enough at court; but here, in the country, he has a satirical, mocking spirit, and likes nothing so much as to embarrass people. He is capable, simply for his own amusement, of covering us with ridicule in the eyes of the Liberals.' It was not until the night between Saturday and Sunday, after three days of discussion, that the abbe Maslon's pride gave way before the Mayor's fear, which had turned to courage. The next thing was to write a honeyed note to the abbe Chelan, inviting him to be present at the vener- ation of the relic at Bray-le-Haut, his great age and infirmities permitting. M. Chelan asked for and obtained a letter of invitation for Julien, who was to accompany him in the capacity of sub-deacon. Early on Sunday morning, thousands of peasants, arriving from the neighbouring mountains, flooded the streets of Verrieres. It was a day of brilliant sunshine. At length, about three o'clock, a tremor ran through the crowd; they had caught sight of a beacon blazing on a rock two leagues from Verrieres. This signal announced that the King had just entered the territory of the Department. Immediately the sound of all the

bells and the repeated discharge of an old Spanish cannon belonging to the town proclaimed its joy at this great event. Half the population climbed up on the roofs. All the women were on the balconies. The Guard of Honour began to move. The brilliant uniforms were greatly ad- mired, each of the onlookers recognised a relative or friend. There was general laughter at the alarm of M. de Moirod, whose cautious hand lay ready at any moment to clutch hold of his saddle. But one thing made them forget all the others: the left-hand man in the ninth section was a handsome lad, very slender, who at first was not identified. Presently a cry of indignation from some, the astonished silence of others announced a general sensation. The onlookers recognised in this young man, riding one of M. Valenod's Norman horses, young Sorel, the carpenter's son. There was one unanimous outcry against the Mayor, especially among the Liberals. What, because this young labourer dressed up as a priest was tutor to his brats, he had the audacity to appoint him to the Guard of Honour, to the exclusion of M. This and M. That, wealthy manufactur- ers! 'Those gentlemen,' said a banker's wife, 'ought really to offer an af- front to the little upstart, born in the gutter.' 'He has a wicked temper and he is wearing a sabre,' replied her com- panion; 'he would be quite treacherous enough to slash them across the face.' The comments made by the aristocratic element were more dangerous. The ladies asked themselves whether the Mayor alone was responsible for this grave breach of etiquette. On the whole justice was done to his contempt for humble birth. While he was giving rise to so much comment, Julien was the happiest man alive. Bold by nature, he had a better seat on a horse than most of the young men of this mountain town. He saw in the eyes of the women that they were talking about him. His epaulettes were more brilliant because they were new. At every moment his horse threatened to rear; he was in the seventh heaven of joy. His happiness knew no bounds when, as they passed near the old rampart, the sound of the small cannon made his horse swerve out of the ranks. By the greatest accident, he did not fall off; from that moment he felt himself a hero. He was Napoleon's orderly officer and was charging a battery. There was one person happier than he. First of all she had watched him pass from one of the windows of the town hall; then, getting into her carriage, and rapidly making a wide detour, she was in time to tremble

when his horse carried him out of the ranks. Finally, her carriage passing out at a gallop through another of the gates of the town, she made her way back to the road along which the King was to pass, and was able to follow the Guard of Honour at a distance of twenty paces, in a noble cloud of dust. Ten thousand peasants shouted: 'Long live the King' when the Mayor had the honour of addressing His Majesty. An hour later, when, having listened to all the speeches, the King was about to enter the town, the small cannon began to fire again with frenzied haste. But an accident occurred, not to the gunners who had learned their trade at Leipsic and Montmirail, but to the future Principal Deputy, M. de Moirod. His horse dropped him gently into the one puddle to be found along the whole road, which created a scandal, because he had to be pulled out of the way to enable the King's carriage to pass. His Majesty alighted at the fine new church, which was decked out for the occasion with all its crimson hangings. The King was to halt for din- ner, immediately after which he would take the road again to go and venerate the famous relic of Saint Clement. No sooner was the King in- side the church than Julien went off at a gallop to M. de Renal's. There he discarded with a sigh his fine sky-blue coat, his sabre, his epaulettes, to resume the little threadbare black coat. He mounted his horse again, and in a few minutes was at Bray-le-Haut, which stands on the summit of an imposing hill. 'Enthusiasm is multiplying these peasants,' thought Julien. 'One cannot move at Verrieres, and here there are more than ten thou- sand of them round this old abbey.' Half ruined by the vandalism of the Revolution, it had been magnificently restored since the Restoration, and there was already some talk of miracles. Julien joined the abbe Chelan, who scolded him severely, and gave him a cassock and surplice. He ves- ted himself hurriedly in these and followed M. Chelan, who was going in search of the youthful Bishop of Agde. This was a nephew of M. de La Mole, recently appointed to the See, who had been selected to exhibit the relic to the King. But the Bishop was not to be found. The clergy were growing impatient. They awaited their leader in the sombre, gothic cloister of the ancient abbey. Four and twenty parish priests had been collected to represent the original chapter of Bray-le- Haut which prior to 1789 had consisted of four and twenty canons. Hav- ing spent three quarters of an hour in deploring the youthfulness of the Bishop, the priests decided that it would be a good thing if their Dean were to go and inform His Lordship that the King was on his way, and that it was time they were in the choir. M. Chelan's great age had made him Dean; despite the anger he showed with Julien, he made a sign to

him to follow him. Julien carried his surplice admirably. By some secret process of the ecclesiastical toilet-table, he had made his fine curly hair lie quite flat; but, by an oversight which intensified the anger of M. Chelan, beneath the long folds of his cassock one could see the spurs of the Guard of Honour. When they reached the Bishop's apartment, the tall lackeys smothered in gold lace barely condescended to inform the old cure that His Lord- ship could not be seen. They laughed at him when he tried to explain that in his capacity as Dean of the Noble Chapter of Bray-le-Haut, it was his privilege to be admitted at all times to the presence of the officiating Bishop. Julien's proud spirit was offended by the insolence of the lackeys. He set off on a tour of the dormitories of the old abbey, trying every door that he came to. One quite small door yielded to his efforts and he found himself in a cell in the midst of His Lordship's body-servants, dressed in black with chains round their necks. Seeing his air of haste, these gentle- men supposed that the Bishop had sent for him and allowed him to pass. He went a little way and found himself in an immense gothic chamber, very dark and panelled throughout in black oak; with a single exception, its pointed windows had been walled up with bricks. There was nothing to conceal the coarse surface of this masonry, which formed a sorry con- trast to the venerable splendour of the woodwork. Both sides of this room, famous among the antiquarians of Burgundy, which the Duke Charles the Bold built about the year 1470 in expiation of some offence, were lined with wooden stalls, richly carved. These displayed, inlaid in wood of different colours, all the mysteries of the Apocalypse. This melancholy splendour, degraded by the intrusion of the bare bricks and white plaster, impressed Julien. He stood there in silence. At the other end of the room, near the only window through which any light came, he saw a portable mirror framed in mahogany. A young man, robed in violet with a lace surplice, but bare-headed, was standing three paces away from the mirror. This article appeared out of place in such a room, and had doubtless been brought there from the town. Julien thought that the young man seemed irritated; with his right hand he was gravely giving benedictions in the direction of the mirror. 'What can this mean?' he wondered. 'Is it a preliminary ceremony that this young priest is performing? He is perhaps the Bishop's secretary ... he will be rude like the lackeys ... but what of that, let us try him.' He went forward and passed slowly down the length of the room, keeping his eyes fixed on that solitary window and watching the young

man who continued to give benedictions, with a slow motion but in end- less profusion, and without pausing for a moment. As he drew nearer he was better able to see the other's look of annoy- ance. The costliness of his lace-bordered surplice brought Julien to a standstill some distance away from the magnificent mirror. 'It is my duty to speak,' he reminded himself at length; but the beauty of the room had touched his feelings and he was chilled in anticipation by the harsh words that would be addressed to him. The young man caught sight of him in the glass, turned round, and suddenly discarding his look of irritation said to him in the pleasantest tone: 'Well, Sir, is it ready yet?' Julien remained speechless. As this young man turned towards him, Julien saw the pectoral cross on his breast: it was the Bishop of Agde. 'So young,' thought Julien; 'at the most, only six or eight years older than myself!' And he felt ashamed of his spurs. 'Monseigneur,' he replied timidly. 'I am sent by the Dean of the Chapter, M. Chelan.' 'Ah! I have an excellent account of him,' said the bishop in a courteous tone which left Julien more fascinated than ever. 'But I beg your pardon, Sir, I took you for the person who is to bring me back my mitre. It was carelessly packed in Paris; the silver tissue has been dreadfully frayed at the top. It will create a shocking effect,' the young Bishop went on with a sorrowful air, 'and they are keeping me waiting too.' 'Monseigneur, I shall go and find the mitre, with Your Lordship's permission.' Julien's fine eyes had their effect. 'Go, Sir,' the Bishop answered with exquisite courtesy; 'I must have it at once. I am sorry to keep the gentlemen of the Chapter waiting.' When Julien was halfway down the room, he turned to look at the Bishop and saw that he was once more engaged in giving benedictions. 'What can that be?' Julien asked himself; 'no doubt, it is a religious pre- paration necessary to the ceremony that is to follow.' When he came to the cell in which the servants were waiting, he saw the mitre in their hands. These gentlemen, yielding in spite of themselves to Julien's im- perious glance, surrendered it to him. He felt proud to be carrying it: as he crossed the room, he walked slowly; he held it with respect. He found the Bishop seated before the glass; but, from time to time, his right hand, tired as it was, still gave the

benediction. Julien helped him to put on the mitre. The Bishop shook his head. 'Ah! It will keep on,' he said to Julien with a satisfied air. 'Will you go a little way off?' Whereupon the Bishop walked at a smart pace to the middle of the room, then returning towards the mirror with a slow step, he resumed his air of irritation and went on solemnly giving benedictions. Julien was spellbound with astonishment; he was tempted to guess what this meant, but did not dare. The Bishop stopped, and looking at him with an air from which the solemnity rapidly vanished: 'What do you say to my mitre, Sir, does it look right?' 'Quite right, Monseigneur.' 'It is not too far back? That would look rather silly; but it does not do, either, to wear them pulled down over one's eyes like an officer's shako.' 'It seems to me to be quite right.' 'The King of —— is accustomed to venerable clergy who are doubtless very solemn. I should not like, especially in view of my age, to appear too frivolous.' And the Bishop once more began to walk about the room scattering benedictions. 'It is quite clear,' said Julien, at last venturing to understand, 'he is practising the benediction.' A few moments later: 'I am ready,' said the Bishop. 'Go, Sir, and inform the Dean and the gentlemen of the Chapter.' Presently M. Chelan, followed by the two oldest of the cures, entered by an immense door, magnificently carved, which Julien had not no- ticed. But this time he remained in his place in the extreme rear, and could see the Bishop only over the shoulders of the ecclesiastics who crowded towards this door. The Bishop crossed the room slowly; when he came to the threshold the cures formed in processional order. After a momentary confusion the procession began to move, intoning a psalm. The Bishop came last, between M. Chelan and another cure of great age. Julien found a place for himself quite close to His Lordship, as being attached to the abbe Chelan. They moved down the long corridors of the abbey of Bray-le- Haut; in spite of the brilliant sunshine, these were dark and damp. At length they arrived at the door of the cloister. Julien was speechless with admiration of so fine a ceremony. His heart was divided between the ambition aroused by the Bishop's youthfulness, and the sensibility and

exquisite manners of this prelate. His courtesy was of a very different kind from M. de Renal's, even on his good days. 'The more one rises to- wards the highest rank of society,' thought Julien, 'the more one finds these charming manners.' They entered the church by a side door; suddenly an appalling crash made its ancient vaults resound; Julien thought that the walls were col- lapsing. It was again the small cannon; drawn by eight horses at a gallop, it had just arrived; and immediately on its arrival, brought into action by the gunners of Leipsic, it was firing five rounds a minute, as though the Prussians had been in front of it. But this stirring sound no longer had any effect upon Julien, he dreamed no more of Napoleon and martial glory. 'So young,' he was thinking, 'to be Bishop of Agde! But where is Agde? And how much is it worth? Two or three hundred thousand francs, perhaps.' His Lordship's servants appeared, carrying a magnificent dais; M. Chelan took one of the poles, but actually it was Julien that bore it. The Bishop took his place beneath it. He had really succeeded in giving him- self the air of an old man; our hero's admiration knew no bounds. 'What cannot one do if one is clever!' he thought. The King made his entry. Julien was so fortunate as to see him at close range. The Bishop addressed him with unction, and did not forget to in- clude a slight touch of confusion, extremely flattering to His Majesty. We shall not repeat the account of the ceremonies at Bray-le-Haut; for a fort- night they filled the columns of all the newspapers of the Department. Julien learned, from the Bishop's speech, that the King was descended from Charles the Bold. Later on it was one of Julien's duties to check the accounts of what this ceremony had cost. M. de La Mole, who had secured a bishopric for his nephew, had chosen to pay him the compliment of bearing the whole of the expense himself. The ceremony at Bray-le-Haut alone cost three thou- sand eight hundred francs. After the Bishop's address and the King's reply, His Majesty took his place beneath the dais; he then knelt down most devoutly upon a cush- ion close to the altar. The choir was enclosed with stalls, and these stalls were raised two steps above the pavement. It was on the second of these steps that Julien sat at the feet of M. Chelan, not unlike a train-bearer at the feet of his Cardinal, in the Sistine Chapel, in Rome. There were a Te Deum, clouds of incense, endless volleys of musketry and artillery; the peasants were frantic with joy and piety. Such a day undoes the work of a hundred numbers of the Jacobin papers.

Julien was within six paces of the King, who was praying with genu- ine fervour. He noticed for the first time a small man of intelligent ap- pearance, whose coat was almost bare of embroidery. But he wore a sky- blue riband over this extremely simple coat. He was nearer to the King than many other gentlemen, whose coats were so covered with gold lace that, to use Julien's expression, one could not see the cloth. He learned a minute later that this was M. de La Mole. He decided that he wore a haughty, indeed an insolent air. 'This Marquis would not be polite like my dear Bishop,' he thought. 'Ah! The career of a churchman makes one gentle and wise. But the King has come to venerate the relic, and I see no relic. Where can Saint Cle- ment be?' A little clerk, who was next to him, informed him that the venerable relic was in the upper part of the building, in a chapelle ardente. 'What is a chapelle ardente?' Julien asked himself. But he would not ask for an explanation of the words. He followed the proceedings with even closer attention. On the occasion of a visit from a sovereign prince, etiquette requires that the canons shall not accompany the Bishop. But as he started for the chapelle ardente His Lordship of Agde summoned the abbe Chelan; Juli- en ventured to follow him. After climbing a long stair, they came to a very small door, the frame of which was sumptuously gilded. This work had a look of having just been completed. Outside the door were gathered on their knees four and twenty girls, belonging to the most distinguished families of Verrieres. Before opening the door, the Bishop sank on his knees in the midst of these girls, who were all pretty. While he was praying aloud, it seemed as though they could not sufficiently admire his fine lace, his charm, his young and pleasant face. This spectacle made our hero lose all that remained of his reason. At that moment, he would have fought for the Inquisition, and in earnest. Suddenly the door flew open. The little chapel seemed to be ablaze with light. One saw upon the altar more than a thousand candles arranged in eight rows, separated from one another by clusters of flowers. The sweet odour of the purest incense rose in clouds from the gate of the sanctuary. The newly gilded chapel was quite small, but very lofty. Julien noticed that there were on the altar candles more than fifteen feet long. The girls could not restrain a cry of admiration. No one had been admitted to the tiny ante-chapel save the twenty-four girls, the two priests and Julien.

Presently the King arrived, followed only by M. de La Mole and his Great Chamberlain. The guards themselves remained outside, on their knees, presenting their arms. His Majesty flung himself rather than knelt down on the faldstool. It was then only that Julien, pressed against the gilded door, caught sight, beneath a girl's bare arm, of the charming statue of Saint Clement. It was hidden beneath the altar, in the garb of a young Roman soldier. He had in his throat a large wound from which the blood seemed to be flowing. The artist had surpassed himself; the eyes, dying but full of grace, were half closed. A budding moustache adorned the charming mouth, which being slightly open had the effect of being still engaged in prayer. At the sight of this statue, the girl nearest to Julien wept hot tears; one of her tears fell upon Julien's hand. After an interval of prayer in the most profound silence, disturbed only by the distant sound of the bells of all the villages within a radius of ten leagues, the Bishop of Agde asked the King's permission to speak. He concluded a brief but highly edifying discourse with these words, simple in themselves, but thereby all the better assured of their effect. 'Never forget, young Christian women, that you have seen one of the great Kings of the earth upon his knees before the servants of this all- powerful and terrible God. These servants, frail, persecuted, martyred upon earth, as you can see from the still bleeding wound of Saint Cle- ment, are triumphant in heaven. All your lives, I think, young Christians, you will remember this day. You will detest impiety. Always you will re- main faithful to this God who is so great, so terrible, but so good.' At these words, the Bishop rose with authority. 'You promise me?' he said, extending his arm with an air of inspiration. 'We promise,' said the girls, bursting into tears. 'I receive your promise, in the name of our terrible God!' the Bishop concluded in a voice of thunder. And the ceremony was at an end. The King himself was in tears. It was not until long afterwards that Julien was calm enough to inquire where were the bones of the Saint, sent from Rome to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. He was told that they were embodied in the charming wax figure. His Majesty deigned to permit the girls who had accompanied him in- to the chapel to wear a red riband upon which were embroidered the words: 'HATRED OF IMPIETY, PERPETUAL ADORATION.' M. de La Mole ordered ten thousand bottles of wine to be distributed among the peasants. That evening, at Verrieres, the Liberals found an

excuse for illuminating their houses a hundred times more brilliantly than the Royalists. Before leaving the town, the King paid a visit to M. de Moirod.

Chapter To Think Is To Be Full of Sorrow The grotesque character of everyday occurrences conceals from one the real misery of passions. BARNAVE While he was replacing its ordinary furniture in the room that M. de La Mole had occupied, Julien found a piece of stout paper, folded twice across. He read at the foot of the first page: To H. E., M. le Marquis de La Mole, Peer of France, Knight of the Roy- al Orders, etc., etc. It was a petition in the rude handwriting of a cook. Monsieur le Marquis, All my life I have held religious principles. I was in Lyons, exposed to the bombs, at the time of the siege, in '93, of execrable memory. I am a communicant, I go every Sunday to mass in my parish church. I have never failed in my Easter duty, not even in '93, of execrable memory. My cook, for before the revolution I kept servants, my cook observes Friday. I enjoy in Verrieres a general and I venture to say merited respect. I walk beneath the dais in processions, beside the cure and the mayor. I carry, on solemn occasions, a big candle bought at my own cost. The certificates of all of which are in Paris at the Ministry of Finance. I ask Monsieur le Marquis for the Verrieres lottery office, which cannot fail to be vacant soon in one way or another, the present holder being seriously ill, and besides voting the wrong way at the elections; etc. DE CHOLIN On the margin of this petition was an endorsement signed de Moirod, which began with the words: 'I had the honour yesterday to mention the respectable person who makes this request,' and so forth. 'And so even that imbecile Cholin shows me the way that I must fol- low,' Julien said to himself.

A week after the visit of the King of —— to Verrieres, the chief thing to emerge from the innumerable falsehoods, foolish interpretations, ab- surd discussions, etc., etc., to which the King, the Bishop of Agde, the Marquis de La Mole, the ten thousand bottles of wine, the unseated Moirod (who, in the hope of a Cross, did not set foot outside his own door for a whole month after his fall) were in turn subjected, was the ut- ter indelicacy of having jockeyed into the Guard of Honour, Julien Sorel, the son of a carpenter. You ought to have heard, on this topic, the wealthy calico printers, who, morning, noon and night, used to talk themselves hoarse in preaching equality. That proud woman, Madame de Renal, was the author of this abomination. Her reason? The flashing eyes and pink cheeks of that young abbe Sorel were reason enough and to spare. Shortly after their return to Vergy, Stanislas Xavier, the youngest of the children, took fever; at once Madame de Renal was seized by the most fearful remorse. For the first time she blamed herself for falling in love in a coherent fashion. She seemed to understand, as though by a miracle, the appalling sin into which she had let herself be drawn. Al- though deeply religious by nature, until this moment she had never thought of the magnitude of her crime in the eyes of God. Long ago, at the convent of the Sacred Heart, she had loved God with a passionate love; she feared Him in the same way in this predicament. The struggles that rent her heart asunder were all the more terrible in that there was nothing reasonable in her fear. Julien discovered that any recourse to argument irritated instead of calming her; she saw in it the language of hell. However, as Julien himself was greatly attached to little Stanislas, he was more welcome to speak to her of the child's illness: presently it assumed a grave character. Then her incessant remorse de- prived Madame de Renal even of the power to sleep; she never emerged from a grim silence: had she opened her mouth, it would have been to confess her crime to God and before men. 'I beg of you,' Julien said to her, as soon as they were alone, 'say noth- ing to anyone; let me be the sole confidant of your griefs. If you still love me, do not speak! your words cannot cure our Stanislas of his fever.' But his attempts at consolation produced no effect; he did not know that Madame de Renal had taken it into her head that, to appease the an- ger of a jealous God, she must either hate Julien or see her son die. It was because she felt that she could not hate her lover that she was so unhappy.

'Avoid my presence,' she said to Julien one day; 'in the name of God, leave this house: it is your presence here that is killing my son. 'God is punishing me,' she added in a whisper; 'He is just; I adore His equity; my crime is shocking, and I was living without remorse! It was the first sign of departure from God: I ought to be doubly punished.' Julien was deeply touched. He was unable to see in this attitude either hypocrisy or exaggeration. 'She believes that she is killing her son by lov- ing me, and yet the unhappy woman loves me more than her son. That, how can I doubt it, is the remorse that is killing her; there is true nobility of feeling. But how can I have inspired such love, I, so poor, so ill-bred, so ignorant, often so rude in my manners?' One night the child's condition was critical. About two o'clock in the morning, M. de Renal came to see him. The boy, burning with fever, was extremely flushed and did not recognise his father. Suddenly Madame de Renal threw herself at her husband's feet: Julien saw that she was go- ing to reveal everything and to ruin herself for ever. Fortunately, this strange exhibition annoyed M. de Renal. 'Good night! Good night!' he said and prepared to leave the room. 'No, listen to me,' cried his wife on her knees before him, seeking to hold him back. 'Learn the whole truth. It is I that am killing my son. I gave him his life, and I am taking it from him. Heaven is punishing me; in the eyes of God, I am guilty of murder. I must destroy and humble myself; it may be that such a sacrifice will appease the Lord.' If M. de Renal had been a man of imagination, he would have guessed everything. 'Romantic stuff,' he exclaimed, thrusting away his wife who sought to embrace his knees. 'Romantic stuff, all that! Julien, tell them to fetch the doctor at daybreak.' And he went back to bed. Madame de Renal sank on her knees, half unconscious, with a convulsive movement thrusting away Julien, who was coming to her assistance. Julien stood watching her with amazement. 'So this is adultery!' he said to himself ... 'Can it be possible that those rascally priests are right after all? That they, who commit so many sins, have the privilege of knowing the true theory of sin? How very odd!' For twenty minutes since M. de Renal had left the room, Julien had seen the woman he loved, her head sunk on the child's little bed, motion- less and almost unconscious. 'Here we have a woman of superior intelli- gence reduced to the last extremes of misery, because she has known me,' he said to himself.

The hours passed rapidly. 'What can I do for her? I must make up my mind. I have ceased to count here. What do I care for men, and their silly affectations? What can I do for her? ... Go from her? But I shall be leav- ing her alone, torn by the most frightful grief. That automaton of a hus- band does her more harm than good. He will say something offensive to her, in his natural coarseness; she may go mad, throw herself from the window. 'If I leave her, if I cease to watch over her, she will tell him everything. And then, for all one knows, in spite of the fortune he is to inherit through her, he will make a scandal. She may tell everything, great God, to that—abbe Maslon, who makes the illness of a child of six an excuse for never stirring out of this house, and not without purpose. In her grief and her fear of God, she forgets all that she knows of the man; she sees only the priest.' 'Leave me,' came suddenly from Madame de Renal as she opened her eyes. 'I would give my life a thousand times to know how I can be of most use to you,' replied Julien; 'never have I so loved you, my dear angel, or rather, from this instant only, I begin to adore you as you deserve to be adored. What is to become of me apart from you, and with the know- ledge that you are wretched by my fault! But I must not speak of my own sufferings. I shall go, yes, my love. But, if I leave you, if I cease to watch over you, to be constantly interposing myself between you and your husband, you will tell him everything, you will be ruined. Think of the ignominy with which he will drive you from the house; all Verrieres, all Besancon will ring with the scandal. All the blame will be cast on you; you will never be able to lift up your head again.' 'That is all that I ask,' she cried, rising to her feet. 'I shall suffer, all the better.' 'But, by this appalling scandal, you will be harming him as well!' 'But I humble myself, I throw myself down in the mud; and in that way perhaps I save my son. This humiliation, in the sight of all, is per- haps a public penance. So far as my frailty can judge, is it not the greatest sacrifice that I can make to God? Perhaps he will deign to accept my hu- miliation and to spare me my son! Show me a harder sacrifice and I will hasten to perform it.' 'Let me punish myself. I too am guilty. Would you have me retire to La Trappe? The austerity of the life there may appease your God ... Oh, heaven! Why can I not take upon myself Stanislas's illness?'

'Ah! You love him,' said Madame de Renal, rising and flinging herself into his arms. Immediately she thrust him from her with horror. 'I believe you! I believe you!' she went on, having fallen once more on her knees; 'O my only friend, why are not you Stanislas's father? Then it would not be a horrible sin to love you more than your son.' 'Will you permit me to stay, and henceforward only to love you as a brother? It is the only reasonable expiation; it may appease the wrath of the Most High.' 'And I,' she exclaimed, rising, and taking Julien's head in her hands, and holding it at arm's length before her eyes, 'and I, shall I love you like a brother? Is it in my power to love you like a brother?' Julien burst into tears. 'I will obey you,' he said as he fell at her feet. 'I will obey you, whatever you may bid me do; it is the one thing left for me. My brain is smitten with blindness; I can see no course to take. If I leave you, you tell your husband all; you ruin yourself, and him at the same time. After such a disgrace he will never be elected Deputy. If I stay, you regard me as the cause of your son's death, and you yourself die of grief. Would you like to test the effect of my going? If you like, I will punish myself for our sin by leaving you for a week. I shall pass the time in retreat wherever you choose. At the abbey of Bray-le-Haut, for instance; but swear to me that during my absence you will reveal nothing to your hus- band. Remember that I can never return if you speak.' She promised; he departed, but was recalled after two days. 'It is impossible for me to keep my oath without you. I shall speak to my husband, if you are not constantly there to order me with your eyes to be silent. Each hour of this abominable life seems to me to last a day.' In the end, heaven took pity on this unhappy mother. Gradually Stan- islas passed out of danger. But the ice was broken, her reason had learned the magnitude of her sin, she could no more recover her equilib- rium. Remorse still remained, and took the form that it was bound to take in so sincere a heart. Her life was heaven and hell; hell when she did not see Julien, heaven when she was at his feet. 'I am no longer under any illusion,' she told him, even at the moments when she ventured to give absolute rein to her love: 'I am damned, irre- mediably damned. You are young, you have yielded to my seduction, heaven may pardon you; but as for me, I am damned. I know it by an in- fallible sign. I am afraid: who would not be afraid at the sight of hell? But at heart, I am not in the least repentant. I would commit my sin again,

were it to be committed. Let heaven only refrain from punishing me in this world and in my children, and I shall have more than I deserve. But you, at least, my Julien,' she cried at other moments, 'are you happy? Do you feel that I love you enough?' Julien's distrust and suffering pride, which needed above all a love that made sacrifices, could not stand out against the sight of so great, so indubitable a sacrifice, and one that was made afresh every moment. He adored Madame de Renal. 'She may well be noble, and I the son of a working man; she loves me ... I am not to her a footman employed in the part of lover.' Once rid of this fear, Julien fell into all the follies of love, into its mortal uncertainties. 'At least.' she cried when she saw that he doubted her love, 'let me make you happy during the few days we still have to spend together! Let us make haste; tomorrow perhaps I shall be no longer yours. If heaven strikes me through my children, in vain shall I seek to live only for love of you, not to see that it is my crime that is killing them. I shall not be able to survive that blow. Even if I would, I could not; I should go mad.' 'Ah! If I could take your sin upon my conscience, as you so generously wished that you might take Stanislas's fever!' This great moral crisis changed the nature of the sentiment that united Julien to his mistress. His love was no longer merely admiration of her beauty, pride in the possession of her. Their joy was thenceforward of a far higher nature, the flame that de- voured them was more intense. They underwent transports of utter madness. Their happiness would have seemed great in the eyes of other people. But they never recaptured the delicious serenity, the unclouded happiness, the spontaneous joy of the first days of their love, when Ma- dame de Renal's one fear was that of not being loved enough by Julien. Their happiness assumed at times the aspect of crime. In what were their happiest, and apparently their calmest moments: 'Oh! Great God! I see hell before me,' Madame de Renal would suddenly exclaim, gripping Julien's hand with a convulsive movement. 'What fear- ful torments! I have well deserved them.' She clutched him, clinging to him like the ivy to the wall. Julien tried in vain to calm this agitated soul. She took his hand, which she covered with kisses. Then, relapsing into a sombre meditation; 'Hell,' she said, 'hell would be a blessing to me; I should still have some days in this world to spend with him, but hell here on earth, the death of my children ... Yet, at that price, perhaps my crime would be forgiven me ... Oh! Great God! Grant me not my pardon at that price. These poor

children have done nothing to offend thee; 'tis I, I, the guilt is mine alone! I love a man who is not my husband.' Julien next saw Madame de Renal reach a state that was outwardly tranquil. She sought to take the burden upon herself, she wished not to poison the existence of him whom she loved. In the midst of these alternations of love, remorse and pleasure, the days passed for them with lightning rapidity. Julien lost the habit of reflection. Miss Elisa went to conduct a little lawsuit which she had at Verrieres. She found M. Valenod greatly annoyed with Julien. She hated the tutor and often spoke about him to M. Valenod. 'You would ruin me, Sir, if I told you the truth!' she said to him one day. 'Employers all hang together in important things. They never for- give us poor servants for certain revelations ... ' After these conventional phrases, which the impatient curiosity of M. Valenod found a way of cutting short, he learned the most mortifying things in the world for his own self-esteem. This woman, the most distinguished in the place, whom for six years he had surrounded with every attention, and, unluckily, before the eyes of all the world; this proudest of women, whose disdain had so often made him blush, had taken as her lover a little journeyman dressed up as a tutor. And that nothing might be wanting to the discomfiture of the governor of the poorhouse, Madame de Renal adored this lover. 'And,' the maid added with a sigh, 'M. Julien went to no pains to make this conquest, he has never departed from his habitual coldness with Madame.' It was only in the country that Elisa had become certain of her facts, but she thought that this intrigue dated from far earlier. 'That, no doubt, is why,' she continued bitterly, 'he refused at the time to marry me. And I, like a fool, going to consult Madame de Renal, beg- ging her to speak to the tutor!' That same evening M. de Renal received from the town, with his newspaper, a long anonymous letter which informed him in the fullest detail of all that was going on under his roof. Julien saw him turn pale as he read this letter, which was written on blue paper, and cast angry glances at himself. For the rest of the evening the Mayor never recovered his peace of mind; it was in vain that Julien tried to flatter him by asking him to explain obscure points in the pedigrees of the best families of Burgundy.

Chapter The Anonymous Letters Do not give dalliance Too much the rein; the strongest oaths are straw To the fire i'the blood. The Tempest As they left the drawing-room about midnight, Julien found time to say to his mistress: 'Do not let us meet tonight, your husband has suspi- cions; I would swear that that long letter he was reading with such dis- pleasure is an anonymous one.' Fortunately, Julien locked himself into his room. Madame de Renal conceived the mad idea that this warning was simply a pretext for not coming to see her. She lost her head absolutely, and at the usual hour came to his door. Julien, hearing a sound in the corridor, instantly blew out his lamp. Someone was attempting to open his door; was it Madame de Renal, was it a jealous husband? Early the next morning, the cook, who took an interest in Julien, brought him a book on the cover of which he read these words written in Italian: Guardate alia pagina 130. Julien shuddered at the imprudence, turned to page one hundred and thirty and found fastened to it with a pin the following letter written in haste, bedewed with tears, and without the least attempt at spelling. Ordinarily Madame de Renal spelt quite well; he was moved by this de- tail and began to forget the frightful imprudence. 'So you would not let me in tonight? There are moments when I feel that I have never seen into the depths of your heart. Your look frightens me. I am afraid of you. Great God! Can it be, you have never loved me? In that case, my husband can discover our love, and shut me up in lifelong imprisonment, in the country, apart from my children. Perhaps God wills it so. I shall soon die; but you will be a monster. 'Do you not love me? Are you tired of my follies, of my remorse, impi- ous one? Do you wish to ruin me? I give you an easy method. Go, show this letter to all Verrieres, or rather show it to M. Valenod alone. Tell him

that I love you; but no, utter no such blasphemy; tell him that I adore you, that life only began for me on the day when I first saw you; that in the wildest moments of my girlhood, I had never even dreamed of the happiness that I owe to you; that I have sacrificed my life to you, that I am sacrificing my soul to you. You know that I am sacrificing far more. 'But what does he know of sacrifices, that man? Tell him, tell him, to make him angry, that I defy all evil-speakers, and that there is but one misfortune in the world for me, that of beholding a change in the one man who holds me to life. What a blessing for me to lose it, to offer it in sacrifice, and to fear no longer for my children! 'Doubt not, dear friend, if there be an anonymous letter, it comes from that odious being who, for the last six years, has pursued me with his loud voice, with a list of the jumps his horse has taken, with his fatuity and with the endless enumeration of all his advantages. 'Is there an anonymous letter? Wicked one, that is what I wished to discuss with you; but no, you were right. Clasping you in my arms, for the last time perhaps, I could never have discussed the matter calmly, as I do when I am alone. From this moment our happiness will not be so easily secured. Will that be an annoyance to you? Yes, on the days when you have not received some amusing book from M. Fouque. The sacrifice is made; tomorrow, whether there be an anonymous letter or not, I shall tell my husband that I have received an anonymous letter, that he must instantly offer you a large sum to accept another post, find some decent pretext, and send you back without delay to your family. 'Alas, dear friend, we are going to be parted for a fortnight, perhaps a month! But there, I do you justice, you will suffer as much as I. Still, this is the only way to counteract the effect of this anonymous letter; it is not the first that my husband has received, and on my account too. Alas! How I have laughed at them! 'The whole purpose of my scheme is to make my husband think that the letter comes from M. Valenod; I have no doubt that he is its author. If you leave the house, do not fail to go and establish yourself at Verrieres. I shall contrive that my husband conceives the idea of spending a fort- night there, to prove to the fools that there is no coolness between him and myself. Once you are at Verrieres, make friends with everyone, even the Liberals. I know that all the ladies will run after you. 'Do not go and quarrel with M. Valenod, nor crop his ears, as you once threatened; on the contrary, show him every politeness. The essential thing is that it should be known throughout Verrieres that you are going to Valenod's, or to some other house, for the children's education.

'That is what my husband will never stand. Should he resign himself to it, well, at least you will be living in Verrieres, and I shall see you sometimes. My children, who are so fond of you, will go to see you. Great God! I feel that I love my children more, because they love you. What remorse! How is all this going to end? I am wandering ... Well, you understand what you must do; be gentle, polite, never contemptu- ous with these vulgar personages, I implore you on my knees: they are to be the arbiters of our destiny. Doubt not for a moment that my husband in dealing with you will conform to whatever public opinion may prescribe. 'It is you that are going to provide me with this anonymous letter; arm yourself with patience and a pair of scissors. Cut out of a book the words you will see below; paste them together, with water-glue, on the sheet of blue paper that I send you; it came to me from M. Valenod. Be prepared for a search of your room; burn the pages of the book you mutilate. If you do not find the words ready made, have the patience to compose them letter by letter. To spare you trouble, I have cut the anonymous let- ter short. Alas! If you no longer love me, as I fear, how long mine must seem to you! ANONYMOUS LETTER "MADAME, All your little goings on are known; but the persons to whose interest it is to check them have been warned. From a lingering affection for yourself, I beg you to detach yourself entirely from the little peasant. If you have the wisdom to do this, your husband will believe that the warning he has received was misleading, and he will be left in his error. Bear in mind that I know your secret; tremble, unhappy woman; hence- forward you must tread a straight path, driven by me." 'As soon as you have finished pasting together the words that make up this letter (do you recognise the Governor's style in it?) come out of your room, I shall meet you about the house. 'I shall go to the village, and return with a troubled countenance; I shall indeed be greatly troubled. Great God! What a risk I am running, and all because you thought you detected an anonymous letter. Finally, with a woebegone face, I shall give my husband this letter, which will have been handed to me by a stranger. As for you, go for a walk in the direction of the woods with the children, and do not return until dinner time.

'From the rocks above, you can see the tower of the dovecote. If all goes well, I shall place a white handkerchief there; if not, you will see nothing. 'Ungrateful wretch, will not your heart find out some way of telling me that you love me, before starting on this walk? Whatever may befall me, be certain of one thing: I should not survive for a day a final parting. Ah! bad mother! These are two idle words that I have written, dear Juli- en. I do not feel them; I can think only of you at this moment, I have written them only so as not to be blamed by you. Now that I find myself brought to the point of losing you, what use is there in pretence? Yes, let my heart seem black as night to you, but let me not lie to the man whom I adore! I have been all too deceitful already in my life. Go to, I forgive you if you love me no longer. I have not time to read my letter through. It is a small thing in my eyes to pay with my life for the happy days which I have spent in your arms. You know that they will cost me more than life.'

Chapter Conversation with a Lord and Master Alas! our frailty is the cause, not we! For such as we are made of, such we be. Twelfth Night It was with a childish pleasure that Julien spent an hour in pasting words together. As he left his room he came upon his pupils and their mother; she took the letter with a simplicity and courage, the calmness of which terrified him. 'Is the gum quite dry?' she asked him. 'Can this be the woman who was being driven mad by remorse?' he thought. 'What are her plans at this moment?' He was too proud to ask her; but never, perhaps, had she appealed to him more strongly. 'If things go amiss,' she went on with the same coolness, 'I shall be stripped of everything. Bury this store somewhere in the mountains; it may some day be my last resource.' She handed him a glass-topped case, in red morocco, filled with gold and a few diamonds. 'Go now,' she said to him. She embraced her children, the youngest of them twice over. Julien stood spellbound. She left him at a rapid pace and without looking at him again. > From the moment of his opening the anonymous letter, M. de Renal's life had been a burden to him. He had not been so agitated since a duel that he had nearly had to fight in 1816, and, to do him justice, the pro- spect of receiving a bullet in his person would now have distressed him less. He examined the letter from every angle. 'Is not this a woman's hand?' he asked himself. 'In that case, what woman can have written it?' He considered in turn all the women he knew at Verrieres, without find- ing a definite object for his suspicions. Could a man have dictated the let- ter? If so, what man? Here again, a similar uncertainty; he had earned the

jealousy and no doubt the hatred of the majority of the men he knew. 'I must consult my wife,' he said to himself, from force of habit, as he rose from the armchair in which he had collapsed. No sooner had he risen than 'Good God!' he exclaimed, clapping his hand to his head, 'she is the one person whom I cannot trust; from this moment she is my enemy.' And tears of anger welled into his eyes. It was a fitting reward for that barrenness of heart in which practical wisdom in the provinces is rooted, that the two men whom, at that mo- ment, M. de Renal most dreaded were his two most intimate friends. 'Apart from them, I have ten friends perhaps,' and he turned them over in his mind, calculating the exact amount of comfort that he would be able to derive from each. 'To all of them, to all of them,' he cried in his rage, 'my appalling misfortune will give the most intense pleasure.' Hap- pily for him, he supposed himself to be greatly envied, and not without reason. Apart from his superb house in town on which the King of —— had just conferred everlasting honour by sleeping beneath its roof, he had made an admirable piece of work of his country house at Vergy. The front was painted white, and the windows adorned with handsome green shutters. He was comforted for a moment by the thought of this magnificence. The fact of the matter was that this mansion was visible from a distance of three or four leagues, to the great detriment of all the country houses or so-called chateaux of the neighbourhood, which had been allowed to retain the humble grey tones imparted to them by time. M. de Renal could reckon upon the tears and pity of one of his friends, the churchwarden of the parish; but he was an imbecile who shed tears at everything. This man was nevertheless his sole resource. 'What misfortune is comparable to mine?' he exclaimed angrily. 'What isolation! 'Is it possible,' this truly pitiable man asked himself, 'is it possible that, in my distress, I have not a single friend of whom to ask advice? For my mind is becoming unhinged, I can feel it! Ah, Falcoz! Ah, Ducros!' he cried bitterly. These were the names of two of his boyhood's friends whom he had alienated by his arrogance in 1814. They were not noble, and he had tried to alter the terms of equality on which they had been living all their lives. One of them, Falcoz, a man of spirit and heart, a paper merchant at Verrieres, had purchased a printing press in the chief town of the De- partment and had started a newspaper. The Congregation had determ- ined to ruin him: his paper had been condemned, his printer's licence had been taken from him. In these unfortunate circumstances he

ventured to write to M. de Renal for the first time in ten years. The May- or of Verrieres felt it incumbent on him to reply in the Ancient Roman style: 'If the King's Minister did me the honour to consult me, I should say to him: "Ruin without compunction all provincial printers, and make printing a monopoly like the sale of tobacco."' This letter to an intimate friend which had set the whole of Verrieres marvelling at the time, M. de Renal now recalled, word for word, with horror. 'Who would have said that with my rank, my fortune, my Crosses, I should one day regret it?' It was in such transports of anger, now against himself, now against all around him, that he passed a night of anguish; but, fortunately, it did not occur to him to spy upon his wife. 'I am used to Louise,' he said to himself, 'she knows all my affairs; were I free to marry again tomorrow I could find no one fit to take her place.' Next, he sought relief in the idea that his wife was innocent; this point of view made it unnecessary for him to show his strength of char- acter, and was far more convenient; how many slandered wives have we not all seen! 'But what!' he suddenly exclaimed, pacing the floor with a convulsive step, 'am I to allow her, as though I were a man of straw, a mere ragamuffin, to make a mock of me with her lover? Is the whole of Verri- eres to be allowed to sneer at my complacency? What have they not said about Charmier?' (a notorious local cuckold). 'When he is mentioned, is there not a smile on every face? He is a good pleader, who is there that ever mentions his talent for public speaking? "Ah! Charmier!" is what they say; "Bernard's Charmier." They actually give him the name of the man that has disgraced him. 'Thank heaven,' said M. de Renal at other moments, 'I have no daugh- ter, and the manner in which I am going to punish their mother will not damage the careers of my children; I can surprise that young peasant with my wife, and kill the pair of them; in that event, the tragic outcome of my misfortune may perhaps make it less absurd.' This idea appealed to him: he worked it out in the fullest detail. 'The Penal Code is on my side, and, whatever happens, our Congregation and my friends on the jury will save me.' He examined his hunting knife, which had a keen blade; but the thought of bloodshed frightened him. 'I might thrash this insolent tutor black and blue and turn him from the house; but what a stir in Verrieres and, indeed, throughout the De- partment! After the suppression of Falcoz's paper, when his editor came out of prison, I was instrumental in making him lose a place worth six hundred francs. They say that the scribbler has dared to show his face

again in Besancon, he may easily attack me, and so cunningly that it will be impossible to bring him to justice! That insolent fellow will insinuate in a thousand ways that he has been speaking the truth. A man of family, who respects his rank as I do, is always hated by plebeians. I shall see myself in those frightful Paris papers; my God! what degradation! To see the ancient name of Renal plunged in the mire of ridicule ... If I ever travel, I shall have to change my name; what! give up this name which is my pride and my strength. What a crowning infamy! 'If I do not kill my wife, if I drive her from the house with ignominy, she has her aunt at Besancon, who will hand over the whole of her for- tune to her on the quiet. My wife will go and live in Paris with Julien; Verrieres will hear of it, and I shall again be regarded as a dupe.' This unhappy man then perceived, from the failing light of his lamp, that day was beginning to break. He went to seek a breath of air in the garden. At that moment, he had almost made up his mind to create no scene, chiefly because a scene of that sort would fill his good friends at Verrieres with joy. His stroll in the garden calmed him somewhat. 'No,' he cried, 'I shall certainly not part with my wife, she is too useful to me.' He pictured to himself with horror what his house would be like without his wife; his sole female relative was the Marquise de R—— who was old, idiotic and evil-minded. An idea of the greatest good sense occurred to him, but to put it into practice required a strength of character far exceeding the little that the poor man possessed. 'If I keep my wife,' he said to himself; 'I know my own nature; one day, when she taxes my patience, I shall reproach her with her offence. She is proud, we are bound to quarrel, and all this will happen before she has inherited her aunt's estate. And then, how they will all laugh at me! My wife loves her children, it will all come to them in the end. But I, I shall be the talk of Verrieres. What, they will say, he couldn't even punish his wife! Would it not be better to stick to my sus- picions and to verify nothing? Then I tie my own hands, I cannot after- wards reproach her with anything.' A moment later M. de Renal, his wounded vanity once more gaining the mastery, was laboriously recalling all the stories told in the billiard- room of the Casino or Noble Club of Verrieres, when some fluent talker interrupted the pool to make merry at the expense of some cuckolded husband. How cruel, at that moment, those pleasantries seemed. 'God! Why is not my wife dead! Then I should be immune from ri- dicule. Why am I not a widower! I should go and spend six months in

Paris in the best society.' After this momentary happiness caused by the idea of widowhood, his imagination returned to the methods of ascer- taining the truth. Should he at midnight, after the whole household had gone to bed, sprinkle a few handfuls of bran outside the door of Julien's room? Next morning, at daybreak, he would see the footprints on it. 'But that would be no good,' he broke out angrily, 'that wretched Elisa would notice it, and it would be all over the house at once that I am jealous.' In another story that circulated at the Casino, a husband had made cer- tain of his plight by fastening a hair with a little wax so as to seal up the doors of his wife's room and her lover's. After so many hours of vacillation, this method of obtaining enlighten- ment seemed to him decidedly the best, and he was thinking of adopting it, when at a bend in the path he came upon that wife whom he would have liked to see dead. She was returning from the village. She had gone to hear mass in the church of Vergy. A tradition of extremely doubtful value in the eyes of the cold philosopher, but one in which she believed, made out that the little church now in use had been the chapel of the castle of the Lord of Vergy. This thought obsessed Madame de Renal throughout the time which she had meant to pass in prayer in this church. She kept on pictur- ing to herself her husband killing Julien during the chase, as though by accident, and afterwards, that evening, making her eat his heart. 'My fate,' she said to herself, 'depends on what he will think when he hears me. After these terrible moments, perhaps I shall not find another opportunity to speak to him. He is not a wise creature, swayed by reas- on. I might, if he were, with the aid of my own feeble wits, forecast what he would do or say. But my fate lies in my cunning, in the art of direct- ing the thoughts of this whimsical creature, who becomes blind with an- ger and incapable of seeing things. Great God! I require talent, coolness, where am I to find them?' She recovered her calm as though by magic on entering the garden and seeing her husband in the distance. The disorder of his hair and clothes showed that he had not slept. She handed him a letter which, though the seal was broken, was still folded. He, without opening it, gazed at his wife with madness in his eyes. 'Here is an abomination,' she said to him, 'which an evil-looking man who claims to know you and that you owe him a debt of gratitude, handed to me as I came past the back of the lawyer's garden. One thing I must ask of you, and that is that you send back to his own people, and

without delay, that Monsieur Julien.' Madame de Renal made haste to utter this name, even beginning a little too soon perhaps, in order to rid herself of the fearful prospect of having to utter it. She was filled with joy on beholding the joy that it gave her husband. >From the fixed stare which he directed at her she realised that Julien had guessed aright. Instead of worrying about a very present trouble, 'what intelligence,' she thought to herself. 'What perfect tact! And in a young man still quite devoid of experience! To what heights will he not rise in time? Alas! Then his success will make him forget me.' This little act of admiration of the man she adored completely restored her composure. She congratulated herself on the step she had taken. 'I have proved myself not unworthy of Julien,' she said to herself, with a sweet and secret relish. Without saying a word, for fear of committing himself, M. de Renal ex- amined this second anonymous letter composed, as the reader may re- member, of printed words gummed upon a sheet of paper of a bluish tinge. 'They are making a fool of me in every way,' M. de Renal said to himself, utterly worn out. 'Fresh insults to be looked into, and all owing to my wife!' He was on the point of deluging her with a stream of the coarsest invective; the thought of the fortune awaiting her at Besancon just stopped him. Over- powered by the necessity of venting his anger on something, he tore up the sheet on which this second anonymous letter was gummed, and strode rapidly away, feeling that he could not endure his wife's com- pany. A minute later, he returned to her, already more calm. 'We must take action at once and dismiss Julien,' she immediately began; 'after all he is only the son of a working man. You can compensate him with a few crowns, besides, he is clever and can easily find another place, with M. Valenod, for instance, or the Sub-Prefect Maugiron; they both have families. And so you will not be doing him any harm ... ' 'You speak like the fool that you are,' cried M. de Renal in a voice of thunder. 'How can one expect common sense of a woman? You never pay attention to what is reasonable; how should you have any know- ledge? Your carelessness, your laziness leave you just enough activity to chase butterflies, feeble creatures which we are so unfortunate as to have in our households ... ' Madame de Renal let him speak, and he spoke at length; he passed his anger, as they say in those parts.

'Sir,' she answered him finally, 'I speak as a woman whose honour, that is to say her most priceless possession, has been outraged.' Madame de Renal preserved an unalterable calm throughout the whole of this trying conversation, upon which depended the possibility of her continuing to live beneath the same roof as Julien. She sought out the ideas that seemed to her best fitted to guide her husband's blind an- ger. She had remained unmoved by all the insulting remarks that he had addressed to her, she did not hear them, she was thinking all the time of Julien. 'Will he be pleased with me?' 'This little peasant upon whom we have lavished every attention, in- cluding presents, may be innocent,' she said at length, 'but he is none the less the occasion of the first insult I have ever received ... Sir, when I read that abominable document, I vowed that either he or I should leave your roof.' 'Do you wish to create a scandal that will dishonour me and yourself as well? You'll be giving a fine treat to many people in Verrieres.' 'That is true; they are all jealous of the state of prosperity to which your wise management has brought you, your family and the town ... Very well, I shall go and bid Julien ask you for leave to spend a month with that timber merchant in the mountain, a fit companion for that little workman.' 'Take care what you do,' put in M. de Renal, calmly enough. 'The one thing I must insist on is that you do not speak to him. You would show temper and make him cross with me; you know how touchy the little gentleman is.' 'That young man has no tact,' went on Madame de Renal; 'he may be learned, you know about that, but at bottom he is nothing but a peasant. For my own part, I have never had any opinion of him since he refused to marry Elisa, it was a fortune ready made; and all because now and again she pays a secret visit to M. Valenod.' 'Ah!' said M. de Renal, raising his eyebrows as far as they would go, 'what, did Julien tell you that?' 'No, not exactly; he has always spoken to me of the vocation that is calling him to the sacred ministry; but believe me, the first vocation for the lower orders is to find their daily bread. He made it fairly clear to me that he was not unaware of these secret visits.' 'And I, I, knew nothing about them!' cried M. de Renal, all his fury re- turning, emphasising every word. 'There are things going on in my house of which I know nothing ... What! There has been something between Elisa and Valenod?'

'Oh, that's an old story, my dear friend,' Madame de Renal said laugh- ing, 'and I daresay no harm was done. It was in the days when your good friend Valenod would not have been sorry to have it thought in Verrieres that there was a little love—of a purely platonic sort—exchanged between him and me.' 'I had that idea at one time,' cried M. de Renal striking his head in his fury as he advanced from one discovery to another, 'and you never said a word to me about it?' 'Was I to make trouble between two friends all for a little outburst of vanity on the part of our dear Governor? What woman is there in society to whom he has not addressed one or more letters, extremely witty and even a trifle gallant?' 'Has he written to you?' 'He writes frequently.' 'Show me his letters this instant, I order you'; and M. de Renal added six feet to his stature. 'I shall do nothing of the sort,' the answer came in a tone so gentle as to be almost indifferent, 'I shall let you see them some other day, when you are more yourself.' 'This very instant, damn it!' cried M. de Renal, blind with rage, and yet happier than he had been at any time in the last twelve hours. 'Will you swear to me,' said Madame de Renal solemnly, 'never to quarrel with the Governor of the Poorhouse over these letters?' 'Quarrel or no quarrel, I can take the foundlings away from him; but,' he continued, furiously, 'I want those letters this instant; where are they?' 'In a drawer in my desk; but you may be certain, I shall not give you the key of it.' 'I shall be able to force it,' he cried as he made off in the direction of his wife's room. He did indeed break open with an iron bar a valuable mahogany writ- ing desk, imported from Paris, which he used often to polish with the tail of his coat when he thought he detected a spot on its surface. Madame de Renal meanwhile had run up the hundred and twenty steps of the dovecote; she knotted the corner of a white handkerchief to one of the iron bars of the little window. She was the happiest of women. With tears in her eyes she gazed out at the wooded slopes of the moun- tain. 'Doubtless,' she said to herself, 'beneath one of those spreading beeches, Julien is watching for this glad signal.' For long she strained her ears, then cursed the monotonous drone of the grasshoppers and the twitter of the birds. But for those tiresome sounds, a cry of joy, issuing

from among the rocks, might have reached her in her tower. Her raven- ing gaze devoured that immense slope of dusky verdure, unbroken as the surface of a meadow, that was formed by the treetops. 'How is it he has not the sense,' she asked herself with deep emotion, 'to think of some signal to tell me that his happiness is no less than mine?' She came down from the dovecote only when she began to be afraid that her husband might come up in search of her. She found him foaming with rage. He was running through M. Valenod's anodyne sentences, that were little used to being read with such emotion. Seizing a moment in which a lull in her husband's exclamations gave her a chance to make herself heard: 'I cannot get away from my original idea,' said Madame de Renal, 'Julien ought to go for a holiday. Whatever talent he may have for Latin, he is nothing more, after all, than a peasant who is often coarse and wanting in tact; every day, thinking he is being polite, he plies me with extravagant compliments in the worst of taste, which he learns by heart from some novel ... ' 'He never reads any,' cried M. de Renal; 'I am positive as to that. Do you suppose that I am a blind master who knows nothing of what goes on under his roof?' 'Very well, if he doesn't read those absurd compliments anywhere, he invents them, which is even worse. He will have spoken of me in that tone in Verrieres; and, without going so far,' said Madame de Renal, with the air of one making a discovery, 'he will have spoken like that before Elisa, which is just as though he had spoken to M. Valenod.' 'Ah!' cried M. de Renal, making the table and the whole room shake with one of the stoutest blows that human fist ever gave, 'the anonymous letter in print and Valenod's letters were all on the same paper.' 'At last!' thought Madame de Renal; she appeared thunderstruck by this discovery, and without having the courage to add a single word went and sat down on the divan, at the farther end of the room. The battle was now won; she had her work cut out to prevent M. de Renal from going and talking to the supposed author of the anonymous letter. 'How is it you do not feel that to make a scene, without sufficient proof, with M. Valenod would be the most deplorable error? If you are envied, Sir, who is to blame? Your own talents: your wise administra- tion, the buildings you have erected with such good taste, the dowry I brought you, and above all the considerable fortune we may expect to

inherit from my worthy aunt, a fortune the extent of which is vastly ex- aggerated, have made you the principal person in Verrieres.' 'You forget my birth,' said M. de Renal, with a faint smile. 'You are one of the most distinguished gentlemen in the province,' Ma- dame de Renal hastily added; 'if the King were free and could do justice to birth, you would doubtless be figuring in the House of Peers,' and so forth. 'And in this magnificent position do you seek to provide jealousy with food for comment? 'To speak to M. Valenod of his anonymous letter is to proclaim throughout Verrieres, or rather in Besancon, throughout the Province, that this petty cit, admitted perhaps imprudently to the friendship of a Renal, has found out a way to insult him. Did these letters which you have just discovered prove that I had responded to M. Valenod's over- tures, then it would be for you to kill me, I should have deserved it a hundred times, but not to show anger with him. Think that all your neighbours only await a pretext to be avenged for your superiority; think that in 1816 you were instrumental in securing certain arrests. That man who took refuge on your roof ... ' 'What I think is that you have neither respect nor affection for me,' shouted M. de Renal with all the bitterness that such a memory aroused, 'and I have not been made a Peer!' 'I think, my friend,' put in Madame de Renal with a smile, 'that I shall one day be richer than you, that I have been your companion for twelve years, and that on all these counts I ought to have a voice in your coun- cils, especially in this business today. If you prefer Monsieur Julien to me,' she added with ill-concealed scorn, 'I am prepared to go and spend the winter with my aunt.' This threat was uttered with gladness. It contained the firmness which seeks to cloak itself in courtesy; it determined M. de Renal. But, obeying the provincial custom, he continued to speak for a long time, harked back to every argument in turn; his wife allowed him to speak, there was still anger in his tone. At length, two hours of futile discourse wore out the strength of a man who had been helpless with rage all night. He de- termined upon the line of conduct which he was going to adopt towards M. Valenod, Julien, and even Elisa. Once or twice, during this great scene, Madame de Renal came within an ace of feeling a certain sympathy for the very real distress of this man who for ten years had been her friend. But our true passions are selfish. Moreover she was expecting every moment an avowal of the anonymous letter which he had received overnight, and this avowal never came. To

gain complete confidence, Madame de Renal required to know what ideas might have been suggested to the man upon whom her fate de- pended. For, in the country, husbands control public opinion. A husband who denounces his wife covers himself with ridicule, a thing that every day is becoming less dangerous in France; but his wife, if he does not supply her with money, declines to the position of a working woman at fifteen sous daily, and even then the virtuous souls have scruples about employing her. An odalisque in the seraglio may love the Sultan with all her heart; he is all powerful, she has no hope of evading his authority by a succession of clever little tricks. The master's vengeance is terrible, bloody, but mar- tial and noble: a dagger blow ends everything. It is with blows dealt by public contempt that a husband kills his wife in the nineteenth century; it is by shutting the doors of all the drawing-rooms in her face. The sense of danger was keenly aroused in Madame de Renal on her return to her own room; she was horrified by the disorder in which she found it. The locks of all her pretty little boxes had been broken; several planks in the floor had been torn up. 'He would have been without pity for me!' she told herself. 'To spoil so this floor of coloured parquet, of which he is so proud; when one of his children comes in with muddy shoes, he flushes with rage. And now it is ruined for ever!' The sight of this violence rapidly silenced the last reproaches with which she had been blaming herself for her too rapid victory. Shortly before the dinner bell sounded, Julien returned with the chil- dren. At dessert, when the servants had left the room, Madame de Renal said to him very drily: 'You expressed the desire to me to go and spend a fortnight at Verri- eres; M. de Renal is kind enough to grant you leave. You can go as soon as you please. But, so that the children shall not waste any time, their les- sons will be sent to you every day, for you to correct.' 'Certainly,' M. de Renal added in a most bitter tone, 'I shall not allow you more than a week.' Julien read in his features the uneasiness of a man in cruel torment. 'He has not yet come to a decision,' he said to his mistress, during a moment of solitude in the drawing-room. Madame de Renal informed him rapidly of all that she had done since the morning. 'The details tonight,' she added laughing. 'The perversity of woman!' thought Julien. 'What pleasure, what in- stinct leads them to betray us?

'I find you at once enlightened and blinded by your love,' he said to her with a certain coldness; 'your behaviour today has been admirable; but is there any prudence in our attempting to see each other tonight? This house is paved with enemies; think of the passionate hatred that El- isa has for me.' 'That hatred greatly resembles the passionate indifference that you must have for me.' 'Indifferent or not, I am bound to save you from a peril into which I have plunged you. If chance decrees that M. de Renal speaks to Elisa, by a single word she may disclose everything to him. What is to prevent him from hiding outside my room, well armed ... ' 'What! Lacking in courage even!' said Madame de Renal, with all the pride of a woman of noble birth. 'I shall never sink so low as to speak of my courage,' said Julien coldly, 'that is mean. Let the world judge by my actions. But,' he went on, taking her hand, 'you cannot conceive how attached I am to you, and what a joy it is to me to be able to take leave of you before this cruel parting.'

Chapter Manners and Customs in 1830 Speech was given to man to enable him to conceal his thoughts. MALAGRIDA, S.J. The first thing that Julien did on arriving in Verrieres was to reproach himself for his unfairness to Madame de Renal. 'I should have despised her as a foolish woman if from weakness she had failed to bring off the scene with M. de Renal! She carried it through like a diplomat, and my sympathies are with the loser, who is my enemy. There is a streak of middle-class pettiness in my nature; my vanity is hurt, because M. de Renal is a man! That vast and illustrous corporation to which I have the honour to belong; I am a perfect fool.' M. Chelan had refused the offers of hospitality which the most respec- ted Liberals of the place had vied with one another in making him, when his deprivation drove him from the presbytery. The pair of rooms which he had taken were littered with his books. Julien, wishing to show Verri- eres what it meant to be a priest, went and fetched from his father's store a dozen planks of firwood, which he carried on his back the whole length of the main street. He borrowed some tools from an old friend and had soon constructed a sort of bookcase in which he arranged M. Chelan's library. 'I supposed you to have been corrupted by the vanity of the world,' said the old man, shedding tears of joy; 'this quite redeems the childish- ness of that dazzling guard of honour uniform which made you so many enemies.' M. de Renal had told Julien to put up in his house. No one had any suspicion of what had happened. On the third day after his arrival, there came up to his room no less a personage than the Sub-Prefect, M. de Maugiron. It was only after two solid hours of insipid tittle-tattle, and long jeremiads on the wickedness of men, on the lack of honesty in the people entrusted with the administration of public funds, on the dangers besetting poor France, etc., etc., that Julien saw him come at length to the

purpose of his visit. They were already on the landing, and the poor tu- tor, on the verge of disgrace, was ushering out with all due respect the future Prefect of some fortunate Department, when it pleased the latter gentleman to occupy himself with Julien's career, to praise his modera- tion where his own interests were concerned, etc., etc. Finally M. de Maugiron, taking him in his arms in the most fatherly manner, suggested to him that he should leave M. de Renal and enter the household of an official who had children to educate, and who, like King Philip, would thank heaven, not so much for having given him them as for having caused them to be born in the neighbourhood of M. Julien. Their tutor would receive a salary of eight hundred francs, payable not month by month, 'which is not noble,' said M. de Maugiron, but quarterly, and in advance to boot. It was now the turn of Julien who, for an hour and a half, had been waiting impatiently for an opportunity to speak. His reply was perfect, and as long as a pastoral charge; it let everything be understood, and at the same time said nothing definite. A listener would have found in it at once respect for M. de Renal, veneration for the people of Verrieres and gratitude towards the illustrious Sub-Prefect. The said Sub-Prefect, as- tonished at finding a bigger Jesuit than himself, tried in vain to obtain something positive. Julien, overjoyed, seized the opportunity to try his skill and began his answer over again in different terms. Never did the most eloquent Minister, seeking to monopolise the last hours of a sitting when the Chamber seems inclined to wake up, say less in more words. As soon as M. de Maugiron had left him, Julien broke out in helpless laughter. To make the most of his Jesuitical bent, he wrote a letter of nine pages to M. de Renal, in which he informed him of everything that had been said to him, and humbly asked his advice. 'Why, that rascal never even told me the name of the person who is making the offer! It will be M. Valenod, who sees in my banishment to Verrieres the effect of his an- onymous letter.' His missive dispatched, Julien, as happy as a hunter who at six in the morning on a fine autumn day emerges upon a plain teeming with game, went out to seek the advice of M. Chelan. But before he arrived at the good cure's house, heaven, which was anxious to shower its bless- ings on him, threw him into the arms of M. Valenod, from whom he did not conceal the fact that his heart was torn; a penniless youth like himself was bound to devote himself entirely to the vocation which heaven had placed in his heart, but a vocation was not everything in this vile world. To be a worthy labourer in the Lord's vineyard, and not to be altogether

unworthy of all one's learned fellow-labourers, one required education; one required to spend in the seminary at Besancon two very expensive years; it became indispensable, therefore, to save money, which was con- siderably easier with a salary of eight hundred francs paid quarterly, than with six hundred francs which melted away month by month. On the other hand, did not heaven, by placing him with the Renal boys, and above all by inspiring in him a particular attachment to them, seem to in- dicate to him that it would be a mistake to abandon this form of educa- tion for another? ... Julien arrived at such a pitch of perfection in this kind of eloquence, which has taken the place of the swiftness of action of the Empire, that he ended by growing tired of the sound of his own voice. Returning to the house he found one of M. Valenod's servants in full livery, who had been looking for him all over the town, with a note invit- ing him to dinner that very day. Never had Julien set foot in the man's house; only a few days earlier, his chief thought was how he might give him a thorough good thrashing without subsequent action by the police. Although dinner was not to be until one o'clock, Julien thought it more respectful to present himself at half past twelve in the study of the Governor of the Poorhouse. He found him displaying his importance amid a mass of papers. His huge black whiskers, his enormous quantity of hair, his night-cap poised askew on the top of his head, his immense pipe, his embroidered slippers, the heavy gold chains slung across his chest in every direction, and all the equipment of a provincial financier, who imagines himself to be a ladies' man, made not the slightest impression upon Julien; he only thought all the more of the thrashing that he owed him. He craved the honour of being presented to Madame Valenod; she was making her toilet and could not see him. To make up for this, he had the privilege of witnessing that of the Governor of the Poorhouse. They then proceeded to join Madame Valenod, who presented her children to him with tears in her eyes. This woman, one of the most important people in Verrieres, had a huge masculine face, which she had plastered with rouge for this great ceremony. She displayed all the pathos of ma- ternal feelings. Julien thought of Madame de Renal. His distrustful nature made him scarcely susceptible to any memories save those that are evoked by con- trast, but such memories moved him to tears. This tendency was in- creased by the sight of the Governor's house. He was taken through it. Everything in it was sumptuous and new, and he was told the price of

each article. But Julien felt that there was something mean about it, a taint of stolen money. Everyone, even the servants, wore a bold air that seemed to be fortifying them against contempt. The collector of taxes, the receiver of customs, the chief constable and two or three other public officials arrived with their wives. They were followed by several wealthy Liberals. Dinner was announced. Julien, already in the worst of humours, suddenly reflected that on the other side of the dining-room wall there were wretched prisoners, whose ra- tions of meat had perhaps been squeezed to purchase all this tasteless splendour with which his hosts sought to dazzle him. 'They are hungry perhaps at this moment,' he said to himself; his throat contracted, he found it impossible to eat and almost to speak. It was much worse a quarter of an hour later; they could hear in the dis- tance a few snatches of a popular and, it must be admitted, not too re- fined song which one of the inmates was singing. M. Valenod glanced at one of his men in full livery, who left the room, and presently the sound of singing ceased. At that moment, a footman offered Julien some Rhine wine in a green glass, and Madame Valenod took care to inform him that this wine cost nine francs the bottle, direct from the grower. Julien, the green glass in his hand, said to M. Valenod: 'I don't hear that horrid song any more.' 'Gad! I should think not, indeed,' replied the Governor triumphantly. 'I've made the rascal shut up.' This was too much for Julien; he had acquired the manners but had not yet the heart appropriate to his station. Despite all his hypocrisy, which he kept in such constant practice, he felt a large tear trickle down his cheek. He tried to hide it with the green glass, but it was simply impossible for him to do honour to the Rhine wine. 'Stop the man singing!' he mur- mured to himself, 'O my God, and Thou permittest it!' Fortunately for him, no one noticed his ill-bred emotion. The collector of taxes had struck up a royalist ditty. During the clamour of the refrain, sung in chorus: 'There,' Julien's conscience warned him, 'you have the sordid fortune which you will achieve, and you will enjoy it only in these conditions and in such company as this! You will have a place worth perhaps twenty thousand francs, but it must be that while you gorge to repletion you stop the poor prisoner from singing; you will give dinner parties with the money you have filched from his miserable pittance, and during your dinner he will be more wretched still! O Napoleon! How

pleasant it was in your time to climb to fortune through the dangers of a battle; but meanly to intensify the sufferings of the wretched!' I admit that the weakness which Julien displays in this monologue gives me a poor opinion of him. He would be a worthy colleague for those conspirators in yellow gloves, who profess to reform all the condi- tions of life in a great country, and would be horrified at having to un- dergo the slightest inconvenience themselves. Julien was sharply recalled to his proper part. It was not that he might dream and say nothing that he had been invited to dine in such good company. A retired calico printer, a corresponding member of the Academy of Besancon and of that of Uzes, was speaking to him, down the whole length of the table, inquiring whether all that was commonly reported as to his astonishing prowess in the study of the New Testament was true. A profound silence fell instantly; a New Testament appeared as though by magic in the hands of the learned member of the two academies. Julien having answered in the affirmative, a few words in Latin were read out to him at random. He began to recite: his memory did not betray him, and this prodigy was admired with all the noisy en- ergy of the end of a dinner. Julien studied the glowing faces of the wo- men. Several of them were not ill-looking. He had made out the wife of the collector who sang so well. 'Really, I am ashamed to go on speaking Latin so long before these ladies,' he said, looking at her. 'If M. Rubigneau' (this was the member of the two academies) 'will be so good as to read out any sentence in Latin, instead of going on with the Latin text, I shall endeavour to improvise a translation.' This second test set the crown of glory on his achievement. There were in the room a number of Liberals, men of means, but the happy fathers of children who were capable of winning bursaries, and in this capacity suddenly converted after the last Mission. Despite this bril- liant stroke of policy, M. de Renal had never consented to have them in his house. These worthy folk, who knew Julien only by reputation and from having seen him on horseback on the day of the King of ——'s visit, were his most vociferous admirers. 'When will these fools tire of listen- ing to this Biblical language, of which they understand nothing?' he thought. On the contrary, this language amused them by its unfamiliar- ity; they laughed at it. But Julien had grown tired. He rose gravely as six o'clock struck and mentioned a chapter of the new theology of Liguori, which he had to learn by heart in order to

repeat it next day to M. Chelan. 'For my business,' he added pleasantly, 'is to make other people repeat lessons, and to repeat them myself.' His audience laughed heartily and applauded; this is the kind of wit that goes down at Verrieres. Julien was by this time on his feet, everyone else rose, regardless of decorum; such is the power of genius. Madame Valenod kept him for a quarter of an hour longer; he really must hear the children repeat their catechism; they made the most absurd mistakes which he alone noticed. He made no attempt to correct them. 'What ig- norance of the first principles of religion,' he thought. At length he said good-bye and thought that he might escape; but the children must next attempt one of La Fontaine's Fables. 'That author is most immoral,' Julien said to Madame Valenod; 'in one of his Fables on Messire Jean Chouart, he has ventured to heap ridicule on all that is most venerable. He is strongly reproved by the best commentators.' Before leaving the house Julien received four or five invitations to din- ner. 'This young man does honour to the Department,' his fellow-guests, in great hilarity, were all exclaiming at once. They went so far as to speak of a pension voted out of the municipal funds, to enable him to continue his studies in Paris. While this rash idea was making the dining-room ring, Julien had stolen away to the porch. 'Oh, what scum! What scum!' he murmured three or four times, as he treated himself to the pleasure of drinking in the fresh air. He felt himself a thorough aristocrat for the moment, he who for long had been so shocked by the disdainful smile and the haughty superiority which he found lurking behind all the compliments that were paid him at M. de Renal's. He could not help feeling the extreme difference. 'Even if we forget,' he said to himself as he walked away, 'that the money has been stolen from the poor prisoners, and that they are forbidden to sing as well, would it ever occur to M. de Renal to tell his guests the price of each bottle of wine that he offers them? And this M. Valenod, in going over the list of his property, which he does incessantly, cannot refer to his house, his land and all the rest of it, if his wife is present, without saying your house, your land.' This lady, apparently so conscious of the joy of ownership, had just made an abominable scene, during dinner, with a servant who had broken a wineglass and spoiled one of her sets; and the servant had answered her with the most gross insolence.

'What a household!' thought Julien; 'if they were to give me half of all the money they steal, I wouldn't live among them. One fine day I should give myself away; I should be unable to keep back the contempt they in- spire in me.' He was obliged, nevertheless, obeying Madame de Renal's orders, to attend several dinners of this sort; Julien was the fashion; people forgave him his uniform and the guard of honour, or rather that imprudent dis- play was the true cause of his success. Soon, the only question discussed in Verrieres was who would be successful in the struggle to secure the learned young man's services, M. de Renal or the Governor of the Poor- house. These two gentlemen formed with M. Maslon a triumvirate which for some years past had tyrannised the town. People were jealous of the Mayor, the Liberals had grounds for complaint against him; but after all he was noble and created to fill a superior station, whereas M. Valenod's father had not left him an income of six hundred livres. He had been ob- liged to pass from the stage of being pitied for the shabby apple-green coat in which everybody remembered him in his younger days to that of being envied for his Norman horses, his gold chains, the clothes he ordered from Paris, in short, all his present prosperity. In the welter of this world so new to Julien he thought he had dis- covered an honest man; this was a geometrician, was named Gros and was reckoned a Jacobin. Julien, having made a vow never to say any- thing except what he himself believed to be false, was obliged to make a show of being suspicious of M. Gros. He received from Vergy large packets of exercises. He was advised to see much of his father, and com- plied with this painful necessity. In a word, he was quite redeeming his reputation, when one morning he was greatly surprised to find himself awakened by a pair of hands which were clapped over his eyes. It was Madame de Renal who had come in to town and, running up- stairs four steps at a time and leaving her children occupied with a fa- vourite rabbit that they had brought with them, had reached Julien's room a minute in advance of them. The moment was delicious but all too brief: Madame de Renal had vanished when the children arrived with the rabbit, which they wanted to show to their friend. Julien welcomed them all, including the rabbit. He seemed to be once more one of a family party; he felt that he loved these children, that it amused him to join in their chatter. He was amazed by the sweetness of their voices, the simpli- city and nobility of their manners; he required to wash his imagination clean of all the vulgar behaviour, all the unpleasant thoughts the atmo- sphere of which he had to breathe at Verrieres. There was always the

dread of bankruptcy, wealth and poverty were always fighting for the upper hand. The people with whom he dined, in speaking of the joint on their table, made confidences humiliating to themselves, and nauseating to their hearers. 'You aristocrats, you have every reason to be proud,' he said to Ma- dame de Renal. And he told her of all the dinners he had endured. 'Why, so you are in the fashion!' And she laughed heartily at the thought of the rouge which Madame Valenod felt herself obliged to put on whenever she expected Julien. 'I believe she has designs on your heart,' she added. Luncheon was a joy. The presence of the children, albeit apparently a nuisance, increased as a matter of fact the general enjoyment. These poor children did not know how to express their delight at seeing Julien again. The servants had not failed to inform them that he was being offered two hundred francs more to educate the little Valenods. In the middle of luncheon, Stanislas Xavier, still pale after his serious illness, suddenly asked his mother what was the value of his silver spoon and fork and of the mug out of which he was drinking. 'Why do you want to know?' 'I want to sell them to give the money to M. Julien, so that he shan't be a dupe to stay with us.' Julien embraced him, the tears standing in his eyes. The mother wept outright, while Julien, who had taken Stanislas on his knees, explained to him that he must not use the word dupe, which, employed in that sense, was a servant's expression. Seeing the pleasure he was giving Madame de Renal, he tried to explain, by picturesque examples, which amused the children, what was meant by a dupe. 'I understand,' said Stanislas, 'it's the crow who is silly and drops his cheese, which is picked up by the fox, who is a flatterer.' Madame de Renal, wild with joy, smothered her children in kisses, which she could hardly do without leaning slightly upon Julien. Suddenly the door opened; it was M. de Renal. His stern, angry face formed a strange contrast with the innocent gaiety which his presence banished. Madame de Renal turned pale; she felt herself incapable of denying anything. Julien seized the opportunity and, speaking very loud, began to tell the Mayor the incident of the silver mug which Stan- islas wanted to sell. He was sure that this story would be ill received. At the first word M. de Renal frowned, from force of habit at the mere name of silver. 'The mention of that metal,' he would say, 'is always a prelimin- ary to some call upon my purse.'

But here there was more than money at stake; there was an increase of his suspicions. The air of happiness which animated his family in his ab- sence was not calculated to improve matters with a man dominated by so sensitive a vanity. When his wife praised the graceful and witty man- ner in which Julien imparted fresh ideas to his pupils: 'Yes, yes, I know, he is making me odious to my children; it is very easy for him to be a hundred times pleasanter to them than I, who am, after all, the master. Everything tends in these days to bring lawful au- thority into contempt. Unhappy France!' Madame de Renal did not stop to examine the implications of her husband's manner. She had just seen the possibility of spending twelve hours in Julien's company. She had any number of purchases to make in the town, and declared that she absolutely must dine in a tavern; in spite of anything her husband might say or do, she clung to her idea. The chil- dren were in ecstasies at the mere word tavern, which modern prudery finds such pleasure in pronouncing. M. de Renal left his wife in the first linen-draper's shop that she entered, to go and pay some calls. He returned more gloomy than in the morning; he was convinced that the whole town was thinking about nothing but himself and Julien. As a matter of fact, no one had as yet al- lowed him to form any suspicion of the offensive element in the popular comments. Those that had been repeated to the Mayor had dealt exclus- ively with the question whether Julien would remain with him at six hundred francs or would accept the eight hundred francs offered by the Governor of the Poorhouse. The said Governor, when he met M. de Renal in society, gave him the cold shoulder. His behaviour was not without a certain subtlety; there is not much thoughtless action in the provinces: sensations are so infre- quent there that people suppress them. M. Valenod was what is called, a hundred leagues from Paris, a faraud; this is a species marked by coarseness and natural effrontery. His tri- umphant existence, since 1815, had confirmed him in his habits. He reigned, so to speak, at Verrieres, under the orders of M. de Renal; but being far more active, blushing at nothing, interfering in everything, everlastingly going about, writing, speaking, forgetting humiliations, having no personal pretensions, he had succeeded in equalling the credit of his Mayor in the eyes of ecclesiastical authority. M. Valenod had as good as told the grocers of the place: 'Give me the two biggest fools among you'; the lawyers: 'Point me out the two most ignorant'; the of- ficers of health: 'Let me have your two biggest rascals.' When he had

collected the most shameless representatives of each profession, he had said to them: 'Let us reign together.' The manners of these men annoyed M. de Renal. Valenod's coarse nature was offended by nothing, not even when the young abbe Maslon gave him the lie direct in public. But, in the midst of this prosperity, M. Valenod was obliged to fortify himself by little insolences in points of detail against the harsh truths which he was well aware that everyone was entitled to address to him. His activity had multiplied since the alarms which M. Appert's visit had left in its wake. He had made three journeys to Besancon; he wrote sever- al letters for each mail; he sent others by unknown messengers who came to his house at nightfall. He had been wrong perhaps in securing the deprivation of the old cure Chelan; for this vindictive action had made him be regarded, by several pious ladies of good birth, as a pro- foundly wicked man. Moreover this service rendered had placed him in the absolute power of the Vicar-General de Frilair, from whom he re- ceived strange orders. He had reached this stage in his career when he yielded to the pleasure of writing an anonymous letter. To add to his em- barrassment, his wife informed him that she wished to have Julien in the house; the idea appealed to her vanity. In this situation, M. Valenod foresaw a final rupture with his former confederate M. de Renal. The Mayor would address him in harsh lan- guage, which mattered little enough to him; but he might write to Bes- ancon, or even to Paris. A cousin of some Minister or other might sud- denly descend upon Verrieres and take over the Governorship of the Poorhouse. M. Valenod thought of making friends with the Liberals; it was for this reason that several of them were invited to the dinner at which Julien recited. He would find powerful support there against the Mayor. But an election might come, and it went without saying that the Poorhouse and a vote for the wrong party were incompatible. The his- tory of these tactics, admirably divined by Madame de Renal, had been imparted to Julien while he gave her his arm to escort her from one shop to another, and little by little had carried them to the Cours de la Fidelite, where they spent some hours, almost as peaceful as the hours at Vergy. At this period, M. Valenod was seeking to avoid a final rupture with his former chief, by himself adopting a bold air towards him. On the day of which we treat, this system proved successful, but increased the Mayor's ill humour. Never can vanity, at grips with all the nastiest and shabbiest elements of a petty love of money, have plunged a man in a more wretched state

than that in which M. de Renal found himself, at the moment of his en- tering the tavern. Never, on the contrary, had his children been gayer or more joyful. The contrast goaded him to fury. 'I am not wanted in my own family, so far as I can see!' he said as he entered, in a tone which he sought to make imposing. By way of reply, his wife drew him aside and explained to him the ne- cessity of getting rid of Julien. The hours of happiness she had just en- joyed had given her back the ease and resolution necessary for carrying out the plan of conduct which she had been meditating for the last fort- night. What really and completely dismayed the poor Mayor of Verrieres was that he knew that people joked publicly in the town at the expense of his attachment to hard cash: M. Valenod was as generous as a robber, whereas he had shown himself in a prudent rather than a brilliant light in the last five or six subscription lists for the Confraternity of Saint Joseph, the Congregation of Our Lady, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament, and so forth. Among the country gentlemen of Verrieres and the neighbourhood, skilfully classified in the lists compiled by the collecting Brethren, ac- cording to the amount of their offerings, the name of M. de Renal had more than once been seen figuring upon the lowest line. In vain might he protest that he earned nothing. The clergy allow no joking on that subject.

Chapter The Sorrows of an Official Il piacere di alzar la testa tutto l'anno e ben pagato da certi quarti d'ora che bisogna passar. CASTI But let us leave this little man to his little fears; why has he taken into his house a man of feeling, when what he required was the soul of a flunkey? Why does he not know how to select his servants? The ordinary procedure of the nineteenth century is that when a powerful and noble personage encounters a man of feeling, he kills, exiles, imprisons or so humiliates him that the other, like a fool, dies of grief. In this instance it so happens that it is not yet the man of feeling who suffers. The great misfortune of the small towns of France and of elected governments, like that of New York, is an inability to forget that there exist in the world persons like M. de Renal. In a town of twenty thousand inhabitants, these men form public opinion, and public opinion is a terrible force in a country that has the Charter. A man endowed with a noble soul, of gen- erous instincts, who would have been your friend did he not live a hun- dred leagues away, judges you by the public opinion of your town, which is formed by the fools whom chance has made noble, rich and moderate. Woe to him who distinguishes himself! Immediately after dinner, they set off again for Vergy; but, two days later, Julien saw the whole family return to Verrieres. An hour had not gone by before, greatly to his surprise, he discovered that Madame de Renal was making a mystery of something. She broke off her conversations with her husband as soon as he appeared, and seemed almost to wish him to go away. Julien did not wait to be told twice. He became cold and reserved; Madame de Renal noticed this, and did not seek an explanation. 'Is she going to provide me with a suc- cessor?' thought Julien. 'Only the day before yesterday, she was so intim- ate with me! But they say that this is how great ladies behave. They are like kings, no one receives so much attention as the minister who, on go- ing home, finds the letter announcing his dismissal.'

Julien remarked that in these conversations, which ceased abruptly on his approach, there was frequent mention of a big house belonging to the municipality of Verrieres, old, but large and commodious, and situated opposite the church, in the most valuable quarter of the town. 'What con- nection can there be between that house and a new lover?' Julien asked himself. In his distress of mind, he repeated to himself those charming lines of Francois I, which seemed to him new, because it was not a month since Madame de Renal had taught them to him. At that time, by how many vows, by how many caresses had not each line been proved false! Souvent femme varie Bien fol est qui s'y fie. M. de Renal set off by post for Besancon. This journey was decided upon at two hours' notice, he seemed greatly troubled. On his return, he flung a large bundle wrapped in grey paper on the table. 'So much for that stupid business,' he said to his wife. An hour later, Julien saw the bill-sticker carrying off this large bundle; he followed him hastily. 'I shall learn the secret at the first street corner.' He waited impatiently behind the bill-sticker, who with his fat brush was slapping paste on the back of the bill. No sooner was it in its place than Julien's curiosity read on it the announcement in full detail of the sale by public auction of the lease of that large and old house which re- curred so frequently in M. de Renal's conversations with his wife. The as- signation was announced for the following day at two o'clock, in the town hall, on the extinction of the third light. Julien was greatly disap- pointed; he considered the interval to be rather short: how could all the possible bidders come to know of the sale in time? But apart from this, the bill, which was dated a fortnight earlier and which he read from be- ginning to end in three different places, told him nothing. He went to inspect the vacant house. The porter, who did not see him approach, was saying mysteriously to a friend: 'Bah! It's a waste of time. M. Maslon promised him he should have it for three hundred francs; and as the Mayor kicked, he was sent to the Bishop's Palace, by the Vicar-General de Frilair.' Julien's appearance on the scene seemed greatly to embarrass the two cronies, who did not say another word. Julien did not fail to attend the auction. There was a crowd of people in an ill-lighted room; but everyone eyed his neighbours in a singular fashion. Every eye was fixed on a table, where Julien saw, on a pewter plate, three lighted candle-ends. The crier was shouting: 'Three hundred francs, gentlemen!'

'Three hundred francs! It is too bad!' one man murmured to another. Julien was standing between them. 'It is worth more than eight hundred; I am going to cover the bid.' 'It's cutting off your nose to spite your face. What are you going to gain by bringing M. Maslon, M. Valenod, the Bishop, his terrible Vicar-Gener- al de Frilair and the whole of their gang down upon you?' 'Three hundred and twenty,' the other shouted. 'Stupid idiot!' retorted his neighbour. 'And here's one of the Mayor's spies,' he added pointing at Julien. Julien turned sharply to rebuke him for this speech; but the two Franc- Comtois paid no attention to him. Their coolness restored his own. At this moment the last candle-end went out, and the drawling voice of the crier assigned the house for a lease of nine years to M. de Saint-Giraud, chief secretary at the Prefecture of ——, and for three hundred and thirty francs. As soon as the Mayor had left the room, the discussion began. 'That's thirty francs Grogeot's imprudence has earned for the town,' said one. 'But M. de Saint-Giraud,' came the answer, 'will have his revenge on Grogeot, he will pass it on.' 'What a scandal,' said a stout man on Julien's left: 'a house for which I'ld have given, myself, eight hundred francs as a factory, and then it would have been a bargain.' 'Bah!' replied a young Liberal manufacturer, 'isn't M. de Saint-Giraud one of the Congregation? Haven't his four children all got bursaries? Poor man! The town of Verrieres is simply bound to increase his income with an allowance of five hundred francs; that is all.' 'And to think that the Mayor hasn't been able to stop it!' remarked a third. 'For he may be an Ultra, if you like, but he's not a thief.' 'He's not a thief?' put in another; 'it's a regular thieves' kitchen. Everything goes into a common fund, and is divided up at the end of the year. But there's young Sorel; let us get away.' Julien went home in the worst of tempers; he found Madame de Renal greatly depressed. 'Have you come from the sale?' she said to him. 'Yes, Ma'am, where I had the honour to be taken for the Mayor's spy.' 'If he had taken my advice, he would have gone away somewhere.' At that moment, M. de Renal appeared; he was very sombre. Dinner was eaten in silence. M. de Renal told Julien to accompany the children

to Vergy; they travelled in unbroken gloom. Madame de Renal tried to comfort her husband. 'Surely you are accustomed to it, my dear.' That evening, they were seated in silence round the domestic hearth; the crackle of the blazing beech logs was their sole distraction. It was one of those moments of depression which are to be found in the most united families. One of the children uttered a joyful cry. 'There's the bell! The bell!' 'Egad, if it's M. de Saint-Giraud come to get hold of me, on the excuse of thanking me, I shall give him a piece of my mind; it's too bad. It's Valenod that he has to thank, and it is I who am compromised. What am I going to say if those pestilent Jacobin papers get hold of the story, and make me out a M. Nonante-Cinq?' 3 A good-looking man, with bushy black whiskers, entered the room at this moment in the wake of the servant. 'M. le Maire, I am Signor Geronimo. Here is a letter which M. le Chevalier de Beauvaisis, attache at the Embassy at Naples, gave me for you when I came away; it is only nine days ago,' Signor Geronimo ad- ded, with a sprightly air, looking at Madame de Renal. 'Signor de Beauvaisis, your cousin, and my good friend, Madame, tells me that you know Italian.' The good humour of the Neapolitan changed this dull evening into one that was extremely gay. Madame de Renal insisted upon his taking supper. She turned the whole house upside down; she wished at all costs to distract Julien's thoughts from the description of him as a spy which twice in that day he had heard ringing in his ear. Signer Geronimo was a famous singer, a man used to good company, and at the same time the best of company himself, qualities which, in France, have almost ceased to be compatible. He sang after supper a little duet with Madame de Renal. He told charming stories. At one o'clock in the morning the chil- dren protested when Julien proposed that they should go to bed. 'Just this story,' said the eldest. 'It is my own, Signorino,' replied Signer Geronimo. 'Eight years ago I was, like you, a young scholar in the Conservatorio of Naples, by which I mean that I was your age; for I had not the honour to be the son of the eminent Mayor of the beautiful town of Verrieres.' This allusion drew a sigh from M. de Renal, who looked at his wife. 3.M. Marsan explains this allusion to a satire by Barthelemy at the expense of the Marseilles magistrate Merindol, who in sentencing him to a fine had made use of the Common Southern expression 'Nonante-cinq' for 'Quatre-vingt-quinze.

'Signer Zingarelli,' went on the young singer, speaking with a slightly exaggerated accent which made the children burst out laughing, 'Signor Zingarelli is an exceedingly severe master. He is not loved at the Conser- vatorio; but he makes them act always as though they loved him. I es- caped whenever I could; I used to go to the little theatre of San Carlino, where I used to hear music fit for the gods: but, O heavens, how was I to scrape together the eight soldi which were the price of admission to the pit? An enormous sum,' he said, looking at the children, and the children laughed again. 'Signer Giovannone, the Director of San Carlino, heard me sing. I was sixteen years old. "This boy is a treasure," he said. '"Would you like me to engage you, my friend?" he said to me one day. '"How much will you give me?" '"Forty ducats a month." That, gentlemen, is one hundred and sixty francs. I seemed to see the heavens open. '"But how," I said to Giovannone, "am I to persuade the strict Zingarelli to let me go?" '"Lascia fare a me."' 'Leave it to me!' cried the eldest of the children. 'Precisely, young Sir. Signor Giovannone said to me: "First of all, caro, a little agreement." I signed the paper: he gave me three ducats. I had nev- er seen so much money. Then he told me what I must do. 'Next day, I demanded an interview with the terrible Signer Zingarelli. His old servant showed me into the room. '"What do you want with me, you scapegrace?" said Zingarelli. '"Maestro" I told him, "I repent of my misdeeds; never again will I break out of the Conservatorio by climbing over the iron railings. I am going to study twice as hard." '"If I were not afraid of spoiling the finest bass voice I have ever heard, I should lock you up on bread and water for a fortnight, you scoundrel." '"Maestro" I went on, "I am going to be a model to the whole school, credete a me. But I ask one favour of you, if anyone comes to ask for me to sing outside, refuse him. Please say that you cannot allow it." '"And who do you suppose is going to ask for a good for nothing like you? Do you think I shall ever allow you to leave the Conservatorio? Do you wish to make a fool of me? Off with you, off with you!" he said, aim- ing a kick at my hindquarters, "or it will be bread and water in a cell." 'An hour later, Signer Giovannone came to call on the Director. '"I have come to ask you to make my fortune," he began, "let me have Geronimo. If he sings in my theatre this winter I give my daughter in marriage."

'"What do you propose to do with the rascal?" Zingarelli asked him. "I won't allow it. You shan't have him; besides, even if I consented, he would never be willing to leave the Conservatorio; he's just told me so himself." '"If his willingness is all that matters," said Giovannone gravely, pro- ducing my agreement from his pocket, "carta canta! Here is his signature." 'Immediately Zingarelli, furious, flew to the bell-rope: "Turn Geronimo out of the Conservatorio," he shouted, seething with rage. So out they turned me, I splitting my sides with laughter. That same evening, I sang the aria del Moltiplico. Polichinelle intends to marry, and counts up on his fingers the different things he will need for the house, and loses count afresh at every moment.' 'Oh, won't you, Sir, please sing us that air?' said Madame de Renal. Geronimo sang, and his audience all cried with laughter. Signor Geronimo did not go to bed until two in the morning, leaving the family enchanted with his good manners, his obliging nature and his gay spirits. Next day M. and Madame de Renal gave him the letters which he re- quired for the French Court. 'And so, falsehood everywhere,' said Julien. 'There is Signor Geronimo on his way to London with a salary of sixty thousand francs. But for the cleverness of the Director of San Carlino, his divine voice might not have been known and admired for another ten years, perhaps ... Upon my soul, I would rather be a Geronimo than a Renal. He is not so highly hon- oured in society, but he has not the humiliation of having to grant leases like that one today, and his is a merry life.' One thing astonished Julien: the weeks of solitude spent at Verrieres, in M. de Renal's house, had been for him a time of happiness. He had en- countered disgust and gloomy thoughts only at the dinners to which he had been invited; in that empty house, was he not free to read, write, meditate, undisturbed? He had not been aroused at every moment from his radiant dreams by the cruel necessity of studying the motions of a base soul, and that in order to deceive it by hypocritical words or actions. 'Could happiness be thus within my reach? ... The cost of such a life is nothing; I can, as I choose, marry Miss Elisa, or become Fouque's part- ner ... But the traveller who has just climbed a steep mountain, sits down on the summit, and finds a perfect pleasure in resting. Would he be happy if he were forced to rest always?'

Madame de Renal's mind was a prey to carking thoughts. In spite of her resolve to the contrary, she had revealed to Julien the whole business of the lease. 'So he will make me forget all my vows!' she thought. She would have given her life without hesitation to save that of her husband, had she seen him in peril. Hers was one of those noble and ro- mantic natures, for which to see the possibility of a generous action, and not to perform it gives rise to a remorse almost equal to that which one feels for a past crime. Nevertheless, there were dreadful days on which she could not banish the thought of the absolute happiness which she would enjoy, if, suddenly left a widow, she were free to marry Julien. He loved her children far more than their father; in spite of his strict discipline, he was adored by them. She was well aware that, if she mar- ried Julien, she would have to leave this Vergy whose leafy shade was so dear to her. She pictured herself living in Paris, continuing to provide her sons with that education at which everyone marvelled. Her children, she herself, Julien, all perfectly happy. A strange effect of marriage, such as the nineteenth century has made it! The boredom of married life inevitably destroys love, when love has preceded marriage. And yet, as a philosopher has observed, it speedily brings about, among people who are rich enough not to have to work, an intense boredom with all quiet forms of enjoyment. And it is only dried up hearts, among women, that it does not predispose to love. The philosopher's observation makes me excuse Madame de Renal, but there was no excuse for her at Verrieres, and the whole town, without her suspecting it, was exclusively occupied with the scandal of her love. Thanks to this great scandal, people that autumn were less bored than usual. The autumn, the first weeks of winter had soon come and gone. It was time to leave the woods of Vergy. The high society of Verrieres began to grow indignant that its anathemas were making so little impression upon M. de Renal. In less than a week, certain grave personages who made up for their habitual solemnity by giving themselves the pleasure of fulfilling missions of this sort, implanted in him the most cruel suspi- cions, but without going beyond the most measured terms. M. Valenod, who was playing a close game, had placed Elisa with a noble and highly respected family, which included five women. Elisa fearing, she said, that she might not find a place during the winter, had asked this family for only about two thirds of what she was receiving at the Mayor's. Of her own accord, the girl had the excellent idea of going

to confess to the retired cure Chelan as well as to the new cure, so as to be able to give them both a detailed account of Julien's amours. On the morning after his return, at six o'clock, the abbe Chelan sent for Julien: 'I ask you nothing,' he said to him; 'I beg you, and if need be order you to tell me nothing, I insist that within three days you leave either for the Seminary at Besancon or for the house of your friend Fouque, who is still willing to provide a splendid career for you. I have foreseen and settled everything, but you must go, and not return to Verrieres for a year.' Julien made no answer; he was considering whether his honour ought to take offence at the arrangements which M. Chelan, who after all was not his father, had made for him. 'Tomorrow at this hour I shall have the honour of seeing you again,' he said at length to the cure. M. Chelan, who reckoned upon overcoming the young man by main force, spoke volubly. His attitude, his features composed in the utmost humility, Julien did not open his mouth. At length he made his escape, and hastened to inform Madame de Renal, whom he found in despair. Her husband had just been speaking to her with a certain frankness. The natural weakness of his character, seeking encouragement in the prospect of the inheritance from Besancon, had made him decide to regard her as entirely innocent. He had just con- fessed to her the strange condition in which he found public opinion at Verrieres. The public were wrong, had been led astray by envious ill- wishers, but what was to be done? Madame de Renal had the momentary illusion that Julien might be able to accept M. Valenod's offer, and remain at Verrieres. But she was no longer the simple, timid woman of the previous year; her fatal pas- sion, her spells of remorse had enlightened her. Soon she had to bear the misery of proving to herself, while she listened to her husband, that a separation, at any rate for the time being, was now indispensable. 'Away from me, Julien will drift back into those ambitious projects that are so natural when one has nothing. And I, great God! I am so rich, and so powerless to secure my own happiness! He will forget me. Charming as he is, he will be loved, he will love. Ah, unhappy woman! Of what can I complain? Heaven is just, I have not acquired merit by putting a stop to my crime; it blinds my judgment. It rested with me alone to win over El- isa with a bribe, nothing would have been easier. I did not take the trouble to reflect for a moment, the wild imaginings of love absorbed all my time. And now I perish.'

One thing struck Julien; as he conveyed to Madame de Renal the ter- rible news of his departure, he was met with no selfish objection. Evidently she was making an effort not to cry. 'We require firmness, my friend.' She cut off a lock of her hair. 'I do not know what is to become of me,' she said to him, 'but if I die, promise me that you will never forget my children. Far or near, try to make them grow up honourable men. If there is another revolution, all the nobles will be murdered, their father may emigrate, perhaps, because of that peasant who was killed upon a roof. Watch over the family ... Give me your hand. Farewell, my friend! These are our last moments to- gether. This great sacrifice made, I hope that in public I shall have the courage to think of my reputation.' Julien had been expecting despair. The simplicity of this farewell touched him. 'No, I do not accept your farewell thus. I shall go; they wish it; you wish it yourself. But, three days after my departure, I shall return to visit you by night.' Madame de Renal's existence was changed. So Julien really did love her since he had had the idea, of his own accord, of seeing her again. Her bitter grief changed into one of the keenest bursts of joy that she had ever felt in her life. Everything became easy to her. The certainty of seeing her lover again took from these last moments all their lacerating force. From that instant the conduct, like the features of Madame de Renal was noble, firm, and perfectly conventional. M. de Renal presently returned; he was beside himself. For the first time he mentioned to his wife the anonymous letter which he had re- ceived two months earlier. 'I intend to take it to the Casino, to show them all that it comes from that wretch Valenod, whom I picked up out of the gutter and made into one of the richest citizens of Verrieres. I shall disgrace him publicly, and then fight him. It is going too far.' 'I might be left a widow, great God!' thought Madame de Renal. But al- most at the same instant she said to herself: 'If I do not prevent this duel, as I certainly can, I shall be my husband's murderess.' Never before had she handled his vanity with so much skill. In less than two hours she made him see, always by the use of arguments that had occurred first to him, that he must show himself friendlier than ever towards M. Valenod, and even take Elisa into the house again. Madame

de Renal required courage to make up her mind to set eyes on this girl, the cause of all her troubles. But the idea had come to her from Julien. Finally, after having been set three or four times in the right direction, M. de Renal arrived of his own accord at the idea (highly distressing, from the financial point of view) that the most unpleasant thing that could happen for himself was that Julien, amid the seething excitement and gossip of the whole of Verrieres, should remain there as tutor to M. Valenod's children. It was obviously in Julien's interest to accept the offer made him by the Governor of the Poorhouse. It was essential however to M. de Renal's fair fame that Julien should leave Verrieres to enter the seminary at Besancon or at Dijon. But how was he to be made to agree, and after that how was he to maintain himself there? M. de Renal, seeing the imminence of a pecuniary sacrifice, was in greater despair than his wife. For her part, after this conversation, she was in the position of a man of feeling who, weary of life, has taken a dose of stramonium; he ceases to act, save, so to speak, automatically, and no longer takes an interest in anything. Thus Louis XIV on his deathbed was led to say: 'When I was king.' An admirable speech! On the morrow, at break of day, M. de Renal received an anonymous letter. It was couched in the most insulting style. The coarsest words ap- plicable to his position stared from every line. It was the work of some envious subordinate. This letter brought him back to the thought of fighting a duel with M. Valenod. Soon his courage had risen to the idea of an immediate execution of his design. He left the house unaccompan- ied, and went to the gunsmith's to procure a brace of pistols, which he told the man to load. 'After all,' he said to himself, 'should the drastic rule of the Emperor Napoleon be restored, I myself could not be charged with the misappro- priation of a halfpenny. At the most I have shut my eyes; but I have plenty of letters in my desk authorising me to do so.' Madame de Renal was frightened by her husband's cold anger, it brought back to her mind the fatal thought of widowhood, which she found it so hard to banish. She shut herself up with him. For hours on end she pleaded with him in vain, the latest anonymous letter had de- termined him. At length she succeeded in transforming the courage re- quired to strike M. Valenod into that required to offer Julien six hundred francs for his maintenance for one year in a Seminary. M. de Renal, heap- ing a thousand curses on the day on which he had conceived the fatal idea of taking a tutor into his household, forgot the anonymous letter.

He found a grain of comfort in an idea which he did not communicate to his wife: by skilful handling, and by taking advantage of the young man's romantic ideas, he hoped to bind him, for a smaller sum, to refuse M. Valenod's offers. Madame de Renal found it far harder to prove to Julien that, if he sac- rificed to her husband's convenience a post worth eight hundred francs, publicly offered him by the Governor of the Poorhouse, he might without blushing accept some compensation. 'But,' Julien continued to object, 'I have never had, even for a moment, the slightest thought of accepting that offer. You have made me too fa- miliar with a life of refinement, the vulgarity of those people would kill me.' Cruel necessity, with its hand of iron, bent Julien's will. His pride offered him the self-deception of accepting only as a loan the sum offered by the Mayor of Verrieres, and giving him a note of hand prom- ising repayment with interest after five years. Madame de Renal had still some thousands of francs hidden in the little cave in the mountains. She offered him these, trembling, and feeling only too sure that they would be rejected with fury. 'Do you wish,' Julien asked her, 'to make the memory of our love abominable?' At length Julien left Verrieres. M. de Renal was overjoyed; at the decis- ive moment of accepting money from him, this sacrifice proved to be too great for Julien. He refused point-blank. M. de Renal fell upon his neck, with tears in his eyes. Julien having asked him for a testimonial to his character, he could not in his enthusiasm find terms laudatory enough to extol the young man's conduct. Our hero had saved up five louis and in- tended to ask Fouque for a similar amount. He was greatly moved. But when he had gone a league from Verrieres, where he was leaving such a treasure of love behind him, he thought only of the pleasure of seeing a capital, a great military centre like Besancon. During this short parting of three days, Madame de Renal was duped by one of love's most cruel illusions. Her life was tolerable enough, there was between her and the last extremes of misery this final meeting that she was still to have with Julien. She counted the hours, the minutes that divided her from it. Finally, during the night that followed the third day, she heard in the distance

the signal arranged between them. Having surmounted a thousand per- ils, Julien appeared before her. > From that moment, she had but a single thought: 'I am looking at you now for the last time.' Far from responding to her lover's eagerness, she was like a barely animated corpse. If she forced herself to tell him that she loved him, it was with an awkward air that was almost a proof to the contrary. Nothing could take her mind from the cruel thought of eternal separation. The suspicious Julien fancied for a moment that she had already forgotten him. His hints at such a possibility were received only with huge tears that flowed in silence, and with a convulsive pressure of his hand. 'But, Great God! How do you expect me to believe you?' was Julien's reply to his mistress's chill protestations. 'You would show a hundred times more of sincere affection to Madame Derville, to a mere acquaintance.' Madame de Renal, petrified, did not know how to answer. 'It would be impossible for a woman to be more wretched ... I hope I am going to die ... I feel my heart freezing ... ' Such were the longest answers he was able to extract from her. When the approach of day made his departure necessary, Madame de Renal's tears ceased all at once. She saw him fasten a knotted cord to the window without saying a word, without returning his kisses. In vain might Julien say to her: 'At last we have reached the state for which you so longed. Hencefor- ward you will live without remorse. At the slightest indisposition of one of your children, you will no longer see them already in the grave.' 'I am sorry you could not say good-bye to Stanislas,' she said to him coldly. In the end, Julien was deeply impressed by the embraces, in which there was no warmth, of this living corpse; he could think of nothing else for some leagues. His spirit was crushed, and before crossing the pass, so long as he was able to see the steeple of Verrieres church, he turned round often.

Chapter A Capital So much noise, so many busy people! So many ideas in the head of a man of twenty! So many distractions for love! BARNAVE At length he made out, on a distant mountain, a line of dark walls; it was the citadel of Besancon. 'How different for me,' he said with a sigh, 'if I were arriving in this noble fortress to be a sublieutenant in one of the regiments entrusted with its defence!' Besancon is not merely one of the most charming towns in France, it abounds in men and women of feeling and spirit. But Julien was only a young peasant and had no way of approaching the distinguished people. He had borrowed from Fouque a layman's coat, and it was in this at- tire that he crossed the drawbridges. His mind full of the history of the siege of 1674, he was determined to visit, before shutting himself up in the Seminary, the ramparts and the citadel. More than once, he was on the point of being arrested by the sentries for making his way into places from which the engineers of the garrison excluded the public, in order to make a profit of twelve or fifteen francs every year by the sale of the hay grown there. The height of the walls, the depth of the moats, the awe-inspiring ap- pearance of the guns had occupied him for some hours, when he happened to pass by the principal cafe, on the boulevard. He stood speechless with admiration; albeit he could read the word Cafe inscribed in huge letters over the two vast doors, he could not believe his eyes. He made an effort to master his timidity; he ventured to enter, and found himself in a hall thirty or forty feet long, the ceiling of which rose to a height of at least twenty feet. On this day of days everything wore an air of enchantment for him. Two games of billiards were in progress. The waiters were calling out the scores; the players hurried round the tables through a crowd of on- lookers. Streams of tobacco smoke, pouring from every mouth,

enveloped them in a blue haze. The tall stature of these men, their roun- ded shoulders, their heavy gait, their bushy whiskers, the long frock coats that coveted their bodies, all attracted Julien's attention. These noble sons of ancient Bisontium conversed only in shouts; they gave themselves the air of tremendous warriors. Julien stood spellbound in admiration; he was thinking of the vastness and splendour of a great capital like Besancon. He felt that he could not possibly summon up courage to ask for a cup of coffee from one of those gentlemen with the proud gaze who were marking the score at billiards. But the young lady behind the counter had remarked the charming ap- pearance of this young country cousin, who, brought to a standstill three paces from the stove, hugging his little bundle under his arm, was study- ing the bust of the King, in gleaming white plaster. This young lady, a strapping Franc-Comtoise, extremely well made, and dressed in the style calculated to give tone to a cafe, had already said twice, in a low voice so modulated that only Julien should hear her: 'Sir! Sir!' Julien's gaze met that of a pair of the most tender blue eyes, and saw that it was himself who was being addressed. He stepped briskly up to the counter and the pretty girl, as he might have advanced in the face of the enemy. As he executed this great move- ment, his bundle fell to the ground. What pity will not our provincial inspire in the young scholars of Par- is, who at fifteen, have already learned how to enter a cafe with so distin- guished an air! But these children, so stylish at fifteen, at eighteen begin to turn common. The passionate shyness which one meets in the provinces now and then overcomes itself, and then teaches its victim to desire. As he approached this beautiful girl who had deigned to speak to him, 'I must tell her the truth,' thought Julien, who was growing cour- ageous by dint of his conquered shyness. 'Madame, I have come for the first time in my life to Besancon; I should like to have, and to pay for, a roll of bread and a cup of coffee.' The girl smiled a little and then blushed; she feared, for this good- looking young man, the satirical attention and witticisms of the billiard players. He would be frightened and would never show his face there again. 'Sit down here, near me,' she said, and pointed to a marble table, al- most entirely hidden by the enormous mahogany counter which pro- truded into the room. The young woman leaned over this counter, which gave her an oppor- tunity to display a superb figure. Julien observed this; all his ideas

altered. The pretty girl had just set before him a cup, some sugar and a roll of bread. She hesitated before calling to a waiter for coffee, realising that on the arrival of the said waiter her private conversation with Julien would be at an end. Julien, lost in thought, was comparing this fair and sprightly beauty with certain memories which often stirred him. The thought of the pas- sion of which he had been the object took from him almost all his timid- ity. The pretty girl had only a moment; she read the expression in Julien's eyes. 'This pipe smoke makes you cough, come to breakfast tomorrow be- fore eight o'clock; at that time, I am almost alone.' 'What is your name?' said Julien, with the caressing smile of happy timidity. 'Amanda Binet.' 'Will you permit me to send you, in an hour's time, a little parcel no bigger than this?' The fair Amanda reflected for a while. 'I am watched: what you ask may compromise me; however, I am now going to write down my address upon a card, which you can attach to your parcel. Send it to me without fear.' 'My name is Julien Sorel,' said the young man. 'I have neither family nor friends in Besancon.' 'Ah! Now I understand,' she exclaimed joyfully, 'you have come for the law school?' 'Alas, no!' replied Julien; 'they are sending me to the Seminary.' The most complete discouragement extinguished the light in Amanda's features; she called a waiter: she had the necessary courage now. The waiter poured out Julien's coffee, without looking at him. Amanda was taking money at the counter; Julien prided himself on having ventured to speak to her: there was a dispute in progress at one of the billiard tables. The shouts and contradictions of the players, echo- ing through that vast hall, made a din which astonished Julien. Amanda was pensive and did not raise her eyes. 'If you like, Mademoiselle,' he said to her suddenly with assurance, 'I can say that I am your cousin.' This little air of authority delighted Amanda. This is no good-for-noth- ing young fellow,' she thought. She said to him very quickly, without looking at him, for her eye was occupied in watching whether anyone were approaching the counter:

'I come from Genlis, near Dijon; say that you are from Genlis too, and my mother's cousin.' 'I shall not forget.' 'On Thursdays, at five o'clock, in summer, the young gentlemen from the Seminary come past the cafe here.' 'If you are thinking of me, when I pass, have a bunch of violets in your hand.' Amanda gazed at him with an air of astonishment; this gaze changed Julien's courage into temerity; he blushed deeply, however, as he said to her: 'I feel that I love you with the most violent love.' 'Don't speak so loud, then,' she warned him with an air of alarm. Julien thought of trying to recollect the language of an odd volume of the Nouvelle Heloise, which he had found at Vergy. His memory served him well; he had been for ten minutes reciting the Nouvelle Heloise to Miss Amanda, who was in ecstasies; he was delighted with his own courage, when suddenly the fair Franc-Comtoise assumed a glacial air. One of her admirers stood in the doorway of the cafe. He came up to the counter, whistling and swaying his shoulders; he stared at Julien. For the moment, the latter's imagination, always flying to extremes, was filled entirely with thoughts of a duel. He turned deadly pale, thrust away his cup, assumed an air of assurance and stud- ied his rival most attentively. While this rival's head was lowered as he familiarly poured himself out a glass of brandy upon the counter, with a glance Amanda ordered Julien to lower his gaze. He obeyed, and for a minute or two sat motionless in his place, pale, determined, and thinking only of what was going to happen; he was really fine at that moment. The rival had been astonished by Julien's eyes; his glass of brandy drained at a gulp, he said a few words to Amanda, thrust his hands into the side pockets of his ample coat, and made his way to one of the bil- liard tables, breathing loudly and staring at Julien. The latter sprang to his feet in a transport of rage; but did not know what action to take to be insulting. He laid down his little bundle and, with the most swaggering gait that he could assume, strode towards the billiard table. In vain did prudence warn him: 'With a duel on the day of your arrival at Besancon, your career in the church is gone for ever.' 'What does that matter, it shall never be said that I quailed before an insult.' Amanda observed his courage; it formed a charming contrast with the simplicity of his manners; in an instant, she preferred him to the big

young man in the long coat. She rose, and, while appearing to be follow- ing with her eyes the movements of someone going by in the street, took her place swiftly between him and the billiard table. 'You are not to look askance at that gentleman; he is my brother-in- law.' 'What do I care? He looked at me.' 'Do you wish to get me into trouble? No doubt, he looked at you, per- haps he will even come up and speak to you. I have told him that you are one of my mother's family and that you have just come from Genlis. He is a Franc-Comtois and has never been farther than Dole, on the road into Burgundy; so tell him whatever you like, don't be afraid.' Julien continued to hesitate; she added rapidly, her barmaid's imagina- tion supplying her with falsehoods in abundance: 'I dare say he did look at you, but it was when he was asking me who you were; he is a man who is rude with everyone, he didn't mean to in- sult you.' Julien's eye followed the alleged brother-in-law; he saw him buy a number for the game of pool which was beginning at the farther of the two billiard tables. Julien heard his loud voice exclaim: 'I volunteer!' He passed nimbly behind Miss Amanda's back and took a step towards the billiard table. Amanda seized him by the arm. 'Come and pay me first,' she said to him. 'Quite right,' thought Julien; 'she is afraid I may leave without paying.' Amanda was as greatly agitated as himself, and had turned very red; she counted out his change as slowly as she could, repeating to him in a whisper as she did so: 'Leave the cafe this instant, or I shan't like you any more; I do like you, though, very much.' Julien did indeed leave, but slowly. 'Is it not incumbent upon me,' he repeated to himself, 'to go and stare at that rude person in my turn, and breathe in his face?' This uncertainty detained him for an hour on the boulevard, outside the cafe; he watched to see if his man came out. He did not however appear, and Julien withdrew. He had been but a few hours in Besancon, and already he had something to regret. The old Surgeon-Major had long ago, notwithstand- ing his gout, taught him a few lessons in fencing; this was all the science that Julien could place at the service of his anger. But this embarrassment would have been nothing if he had known how to pick a quarrel other- wise than by striking a blow; and, if they had come to fisticuffs, his rival, a giant of a man, would have beaten him and left him discomfited.

'For a poor devil like me,' thought Julien, 'without protectors and without money, there will be no great difference between a Seminary and a prison; I must leave my lay clothes in some inn, where I can put on my black coat. If I ever succeed in escaping from the Seminary for an hour or two, I can easily, in my lay clothes, see Miss Amanda again.' This was sound reasoning; but Julien, as he passed by all the inns in turn, had not the courage to enter any of them. Finally, as he came again to the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, his roving gaze met that of a stout woman, still reasonably young, with a high com- plexion, a happy and gay expression. He went up to her and told her his story. 'Certainly, my fine young priest,' the landlady of the Ambassadeurs said to him, 'I shall keep your lay clothes for you, indeed I will have them brushed regularly. In this weather, it is a mistake to leave a broad- cloth coat lying.' She took a key and led him herself to a bedroom, ad- vising him to write down a list of what he was leaving behind. 'Lord, how nice you look like that, M. l'abbe Sorel,' said the stout wo- man, when he came down to the kitchen. 'I am going to order you a good dinner; and,' she added in an undertone, 'it will only cost you twenty sous, instead of the fifty people generally pay; for you must be careful with your little purse.' 'I have ten louis,' retorted Julien with a certain note of pride. 'Oh, good Lord!' replied the good landlady in alarm, 'do not speak so loud; there are plenty of bad folk in Besancon. They will have that out of you in less than no time. Whatever you do, never go into the cafes, they are full of rogues.' 'Indeed!' said Julien, to whom this last statement gave food for thought. 'Never go anywhere except to me, I will give you your coffee. Bear in mind that you will always find a friend here and a good dinner for twenty sous; that's good enough for you, I hope. Go and sit down at the table, I am going to serve you myself.' 'I should not be able to eat,' Julien told her. 'I am too much excited, I am going to enter the Seminary as soon as I leave here.' The good woman would not allow him to leave until she had stuffed his pockets with provisions. Finally Julien set out for the dread spot, the landlady from her doorstep pointing out the way.

Chapter The Seminary Three hundred and thirty-six dinners at 83 centimes, three hun- dred and thirty-six suppers at 38 centimes, chocolate to such as are entitled to it; how much is there to be made on the contract? THE VALENOD OF BESANCON He saw from a distance the cross of gilded iron over the door; he went towards it slowly; his legs seemed to be giving way under him. 'So there is that hell upon earth, from which I can never escape!' Finally he de- cided to ring. The sound of the bell echoed as though in a deserted place. After ten minutes, a pale man dressed in black came and opened the door to him. Julien looked at him and at once lowered his gaze. This porter had a singular physiognomy. The prominent green pupils of his eyes were convex as those of a cat's; the unwinking contours of his eye- lids proclaimed the impossibility of any human feeling; his thin lips were stretched and curved over his protruding teeth. And yet this physiognomy did not suggest a criminal nature, so much as that entire insensibility which inspires far greater terror in the young. The sole feel- ing that Julien's rapid glance could discern in that long, smug face was a profound contempt for every subject that might be mentioned to him, which did not refer to another and a better world. Julien raised his eyes with an effort, and in a voice which the palpita- tion of his heart made tremulous explained that he wished to speak to M. Pirard, the Director of the Seminary. Without a word, the man in black made a sign to him to follow. They climbed two flights of a wide stair- case with a wooden baluster, the warped steps of which sloped at a downward angle from the wall, and seemed on the point of collapse. A small door, surmounted by a large graveyard cross of white wood painted black, yielded to pressure and the porter showed him into a low and gloomy room, the whitewashed walls of which were adorned with two large pictures dark with age. There, Julien was left to himself; he

was terrified, his heart throbbed violently; he would have liked to find the courage to weep. A deathly silence reigned throughout the building. After a quarter of an hour, which seemed to him a day, the sinister porter reappeared on the threshold of a door at the other end of the room, and, without condescending to utter a word, beckoned to him to advance. He entered a room even larger than the first and very badly lighted. The walls of this room were whitewashed also; but they were bare of ornament. Only in a corner by the door, Julien noticed in passing a bed of white wood, two straw chairs and a little armchair made of planks of firwood without a cushion. At the other end of the room, near a small window with dingy panes, decked with neglected flowerpots, he saw a man seated at a table and dressed in a shabby cassock; he ap- peared to be in a rage, and was taking one after another from a pile of little sheets of paper which he spread out on his table after writing a few words on each. He did not observe Julien's presence. The latter remained motionless, standing in the middle of the room, where he had been left by the porter, who had gone out again shutting the door behind him. Ten minutes passed in this fashion; the shabbily dressed man writing all the time. Julien's emotion and terror were such that he felt himself to be on the point of collapsing. A philosopher would have said, perhaps wrongly: 'It is the violent impression made by ugliness on a soul created to love what is beautiful.' The man who was writing raised his head; Julien did not observe this for a moment, and indeed, after he had noticed it, still remained motion- less, as though turned to stone by the terrible gaze that was fixed on him. Julien's swimming eyes could barely make out a long face covered all over with red spots, except on the forehead, which displayed a deathly pallor. Between the red cheeks and white forehead shone a pair of little black eyes calculated to inspire terror in the bravest heart. The vast ex- panse of his forehead was outlined by a mass of straight hair, as black as jet. 'Are you coming nearer, or not?' the man said at length impatiently. Julien advanced with an uncertain step, and at length, ready to fall to the ground and paler than he had ever been in his life, came to a halt a few feet away from the little table of white wood covered with scraps of paper. 'Nearer,' said the man. Julien advanced farther, stretching out his hand as though in search of something to lean upon. 'Your name?'

'Julien Sorel.' 'You are very late,' said the other, once more fastening upon him a ter- rible eye. Julien could not endure this gaze; putting out his hand as though to support himself, he fell full length upon the floor. The man rang a bell. Julien had lost only his sense of vision and the strength to move; he could hear footsteps approaching. He was picked up and placed in the little armchair of white wood. He heard the terrible man say to the porter: 'An epileptic, evidently; I might have known it.' When Julien was able to open his eyes, the man with the red face was again writing; the porter had vanished. 'I must have courage,' our hero told himself, 'and above all hide my feelings.' He felt a sharp pain at his heart. 'If I am taken ill, heaven knows what they will think of me.' At length the man stopped writing, and with a sidelong glance at Julien asked: 'Are you in a fit state to answer my questions?' 'Yes, Sir,' said Julien in a feeble voice. 'Ah! That is fortunate.' The man in black had half risen and was impatiently seeking for a let- ter in the drawer of his table of firwood which opened with a creak. He found it, slowly resumed his seat, and once more gazing at Julien, with an air which seemed to wrest from him the little life that remained to him: 'You are recommended to me by M. Chelan, who was the best cure in the diocese, a good man if ever there was one, and my friend for the last thirty years.' 'Ah! It is M. Pirard that I have the honour to address,' said Julien in a feeble voice. 'So it seems,' said the Director of the Seminary, looking sourly at him. The gleam in his little eyes brightened, followed by an involuntary jerk of the muscles round his mouth. It was the physiognomy of a tiger rel- ishing in anticipation the pleasure of devouring its prey. 'Chelan's letter is short,' he said, as though speaking to himself. 'Intelligenti pauca; in these days, one cannot write too little.' He read aloud: '"I send you Julien Sorel, of this parish, whom I baptised nearly twenty years ago; his father is a wealthy carpenter but allows him nothing. Juli- en will be a noteworthy labourer in the Lord's vineyard. Memory,

intelligence are not wanting, he has the power of reflection. Will his vo- cation last? Is it sincere?"' 'Sincere!' repeated the abbe Pirard with an air of surprise, gazing at Julien; but this time the abbe's gaze was less devoid of all trace of hu- manity. 'Sincere!' he repeated, lowering his voice and returning to the letter: '"I ask you for a bursary for Julien; he will qualify for it by undergoing the necessary examinations. I have taught him a little divinity, that old and sound divinity of Bossuet, Arnault, Fleury. If the young man is not to your liking, send him back to me; the Governor of our Poorhouse, whom you know well, offers him eight hundred francs to come as tutor to his children. Inwardly I am calm, thank God. I am growing accus- tomed to the terrible blow. Vale et me ama."' The abbe Pirard, relaxing the speed of his utterance as he came to the signature, breathed with a sigh the word 'Chelan.' 'He is calm,' he said; 'indeed, his virtue deserved that reward; God grant it to me, when my time comes!' He looked upwards and made the sign of the Cross. At the sight of this holy symbol Julien felt a slackening of the profound horror which, from his entering the building, had frozen him. 'I have here three hundred and twenty-one aspirants for the holiest of callings,' the abbe Pirard said at length, in a severe but not hostile tone; 'only seven or eight have been recommended to me by men like the abbe Chelan; thus among the three hundred and twenty-one you will be the ninth. But my protection is neither favour nor weakness, it is an increase of precaution and severity against vice. Go and lock that door.' Julien made an effort to walk and managed not to fall. He noticed that a little window, near the door by which he had entered, commanded a view of the country. He looked at the trees; the sight of them did him good, as though he had caught sight of old friends. 'Loquerisne linguam latinam? (Do you speak Latin?)' the abbe Pirard asked him as he returned. 'Ita, pater optime (Yes, excellent Father),' replied Julien, who was begin- ning to come to himself. Certainly nobody in the world had appeared to him less excellent than M. Pirard, during the last half-hour. The conversation continued in Latin. The expression in the abbe's eyes grew gentler; Julien recovered a certain coolness. 'How weak I am,' he thought, 'to let myself be imposed upon by this show of virtue! This man will be simply a rascal like M. Maslon'; and Julien congratulated himself on having hidden almost all his money in his boots.

The abbe Pirard examined Julien in theology, and was surprised by the extent of his knowledge. His astonishment increased when he ques- tioned him more particularly on the Holy Scriptures. But when he came to questions touching the doctrine of the Fathers, he discovered that Juli- en barely knew the names of Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Basil, etc., etc. 'In fact,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'here is another instance of that fatal tendency towards Protestantism which I have always had to rebuke in Chelan. A thorough, a too thorough acquaintance with the Holy Scriptures.' (Julien had just spoken to him, without having been questioned on the subject, of the true date of authorship of Genesis, the Pentateuch, etc.) 'To what does all this endless discussion of the Holy Scriptures lead,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'if not to private judgment, that is to say to the most fearful Protestantism? And, in conjunction with this rash learning, nothing about the Fathers that can compensate for this tendency.' But the astonishment of the Director of the Seminary knew no bounds when, questioning Julien as to the authority of the Pope, and expecting the maxims of the ancient Gallican church, he heard the young man re- peat the whole of M. de Maistre's book. 'A strange man, Chelan,' thought the abbe Pirard; 'has he given him this book to teach him to laugh at it?' In vain did he question Julien, trying to discover whether he seriously believed the doctrine of M. de Maistre. The young man could answer him only by rote. From this moment, Julien was really admirable, he felt that he was master of himself. After a prolonged examination it seemed to him that M. Pirard's severity towards him was no more than an affect- ation. Indeed, but for the rule of austere gravity which, for the last fifteen years, he had imposed on himself in dealing with his pupils in theology, the Director of the Seminary would have embraced Julien in the name of logic, such clarity, precision, and point did he find in the young man's answers. 'This is a bold and healthy mind,' he said to himself, 'but corpus debile (a frail body). 'Do you often fall like that?' he asked Julien in French, pointing with his finger to the floor. 'It was the first time in my life; the sight of the porter's face paralysed me,' Julien explained, colouring like a child. The abbe Pirard almost smiled.

'Such is the effect of the vain pomps of this world; you are evidently accustomed to smiling faces, positive theatres of falsehood. The truth is austere, Sir. But is not our task here below austere also? You will have to see that your conscience is on its guard against this weakness: Undue sensibility to vain outward charms. 'Had you not been recommended to me,' said the abbe Pirard, return- ing with marked pleasure to the Latin tongue, 'had you not been recom- mended to me by a man such as the abbe Chelan, I should address you in the vain language of this world to which it appears that you are too well accustomed. The entire bursary for which you apply is, I may tell you, the hardest thing in the world to obtain. But the abbe Chelan has earned little, by fifty-six years of apostolic labours, if he cannot dispose of a bursary at the Seminary.' After saying these words, the abbe Pirard advised Julien not to join any secret society or congregation without his consent. 'I give you my word of honour,' said Julien with the heartfelt warmth of an honest man. The Director of the Seminary smiled for the first time. 'That expression is not in keeping here,' he told him; 'it is too suggest- ive of the vain honour of men of the world, which leads them into so many errors and often into crime. You owe me obedience in virtue of the seventeenth paragraph of the Bull Unam Ecclesiam of Saint Pius V. I am your ecclesiastical superior. In this house to hear, my dearly beloved son, is to obey. How much money have you?' ('Now we come to the point,' thought Julien, 'this is the reason of the "dearly beloved son".') 'Thirty-five francs, Father.' 'Keep a careful note of how you spend your money; you will have to account for it to me.' This exhausting interview had lasted three hours. Julien was told to summon the porter. 'Put Julien Sorel in cell number 103,' the abbe Pirard told the man. As a special favour, he was giving Julien a room to himself. 'Take up his trunk,' he added. Julien lowered his eyes and saw his trunk staring him in the face; he had been looking at it for three hours and had never seen it. On arriving at No. 103, which was a tiny room eight feet square on the highest floor of the building, Julien observed that it looked out towards the ramparts, beyond which one saw the smiling plain which the Doubs divides from the city.

'What a charming view!' exclaimed Julien; in speaking thus to himself he was not conscious of the feeling implied by his words. The violent sensations he had experienced in the short time that he had spent in Bes- ancon had completely drained his strength. He sat down by the window on the solitary wooden chair that was in his cell, and at once fell into a profound slumber. He did not hear the supper bell, nor that for Benedic- tion; he had been forgotten. When the first rays of the sun awakened him next morning, he found himself lying upon the floor.

Chapter The World, or What the Rich Lack I am alone on earth, no one deigns to think of me. All the people I see making their fortunes have a brazenness and a hard-hearted- ness which I do not sense in myself. Ah! I shall soon be dead, either of hunger, or from the sorrow of finding men so hard. YOUNG He made haste to brush his coat and to go downstairs; he was late. An under-master rebuked him severely; instead of seeking to excuse him- self, Julien crossed his arms on his breast: 'Peccavi, pater optime (I have sinned, I confess my fault, O Father),' he said with a contrite air. This was a most successful beginning. The sharp wits among the sem- inarists saw that they had to deal with a man who was not new to the game. The recreation hour came, Julien saw himself the object of general curiosity. But they found in him merely reserve and silence. Following the maxims that he had laid down for himself, he regarded his three hundred and twenty-one comrades as so many enemies; the most dan- gerous of all in his eyes was the abbe Pirard. A few days later, Julien had to choose a confessor, he was furnished with a list. 'Eh; Great God, for what do they take me?' he said to himself. 'Do they suppose I can't take a hint?' And he chose the abbe Pirard. Though he did not suspect it, this step was decisive. A little seminarist, still quite a boy, and a native of Verrieres, who, from the first day, had declared himself his friend, informed him that if he had chosen M. Castanede, the vice-principal of the Seminary, he would perhaps have shown greater prudence. 'The abbe Castanede is the enemy of M. Pirard, who is suspected of Jansenism'; the little seminarist added, whispering this information in his ear.

All the first steps taken by our hero who fancied himself so prudent were, like his choice of a confessor, foolish in the extreme. Led astray by all the presumption of an imaginative man, he mistook his intentions for facts, and thought himself a consummate hypocrite. His folly went the length of his reproaching himself for his successes in this art of the weak. 'Alas! It is my sole weapon! In another epoch, it would have been by speaking actions in the face of the enemy that I should have earned my bread.' Julien, satisfied with his own conduct, looked around him; he found everywhere an appearance of the purest virtue. Nine or ten of the seminarists lived in the odour of sanctity, and had visions like Saint Teresa and Saint Francis, when he received the Stig- mata upon Monte Verna, in the Apennines. But this was a great secret which their friends kept to themselves. These poor young visionaries were almost always in the infirmary. Some hundred others combined with a robust faith an unwearying application. They worked until they made themselves ill, but without learning much. Two or three distin- guished themselves by real talent, and, among these, one named Chazel; but Julien felt himself repelled by them, and they by him. The rest of the three hundred and twenty-one seminarists were com- posed entirely of coarse creatures who were by no means certain that they understood the Latin words which they repeated all day long. Al- most all of them were the sons of peasants, and preferred to earn their bread by reciting a few Latin words rather than by tilling the soil. It was after making this discovery, in the first few days, that Julien promised himself a rapid success. 'In every service, there is need of intelligent people, for after all there is work to be done,' he told himself. 'Under Na- poleon, I should have been a serjeant; among these future cures, I shall be a Vicar-General. 'All these poor devils,' he added, 'labourers from the cradle, have lived, until they came here, upon skim milk and black bread. In their cot- tages, they tasted meat only five or six times in a year. Like the Roman soldiers who found active service a holiday, these boorish peasants are enchanted by the luxuries of the Seminary.' Julien never read anything in their lack-lustre eyes beyond the satisfac- tion of a bodily need after dinner, and the expectation of a bodily pleas- ure before the meal. Such were the people among whom he must distin- guish himself; but what Julien did not know, what they refrained from telling him, was that to be at the top of the various classes of dogma, church history, etc., etc., which were studied in the Seminary, was

nothing more in their eyes than a sin of vainglory. Since Voltaire, since Two Chamber government, which is at bottom only distrust and private judgment, and instils in the hearts of the people that fatal habit of want of confidence, the Church of France seems to have realised that books are its true enemies. It is heartfelt submission that is everything in its eyes. Suc- cess in studies, even in sacred studies, is suspect, and with good reason. What is to prevent the superior man from going over to the other side, like Sieyes or Gregoire? The trembling Church clings to the Pope as to her sole chance of salvation. The Pope alone can attempt to paralyse private judgment, and, by the pious pomps of the ceremonies of his court, make an impression upon the sick and listless minds of men and women of the world. Having half mastered these several truths, which however all the words uttered in a Seminary tend to deny, Julien fell into a deep melan- choly. He worked hard, and rapidly succeeded in learning things of great value to a priest, entirely false in his eyes, and in which he took no interest. He imagined that there was nothing else for him to do. 'Am I then forgotten by all the world?' he wondered. He little knew that M. Pirard had received and had flung in the fire several letters bear- ing the Dijon postmark, letters in which, despite the most conventional style and language, the most intense passion was apparent. Keen re- morse seemed to be doing battle with this love. 'So much the better,' thought the abbe Pirard, 'at least it is not an irreligious woman that this young man has loved.' One day, the abbe Pirard opened a letter which seemed to be half ob- literated by tears, it was an eternal farewell. 'At last,' the writer informed Julien, 'heaven has granted me the grace of hating not the author of my fault, he will always be dearer to me than anything in the world, but my fault itself. The sacrifice is made, my friend. It is not without tears, as you see. The salvation of the beings to whom I am bound, and whom you have loved so dearly, has prevailed. A just but terrible God can no longer wreak vengeance upon them for their mother's crimes. Farewell, Julien, be just towards men.' This ending to the letter was almost entirely illegible. The writer gave an address at Dijon, and at the same time hoped that Julien would never reply, or that at least he would confine himself to language which a wo- man restored to the ways of virtue could read without blushing. Julien's melancholy, assisted by the indifferent food supplied to the Seminary by the contractor for dinners at 83 centimes a head, was

beginning to have an effect on his health, when one morning Fouque suddenly appeared in his room. 'At last I have found my way in. I have come five times to Besancon, honour bound, to see you. Always a barred door. I posted someone at the gate of the Seminary; why the devil do you never come out?' 'It is a test which I have set myself.' 'I find you greatly altered. At last I see you again. Two good five franc pieces have just taught me that I was no better than a fool not to have offered them on my first visit.' The conversation between the friends was endless. Julien changed col- our when Fouque said to him: 'Have you heard, by the way? The mother of your pupils has become most devoutly religious.' And he spoke with that detached air which makes so singular an im- pression on the passionate soul whose dearest interests the speaker un- consciously destroys. 'Yes, my friend, the most exalted strain of piety. They say that she makes pilgrimages. But, to the eternal shame of the abbe Maslon, who has been spying so long upon that poor M. Chelan, Madame de Renal will have nothing to do with him. She goes to confession at Dijon or Besancon.' 'She comes to Besancon!' said Julien, his brow flushing. 'Quite often,' replied Fouque with a questioning air. 'Have you any Constitutionnels on you?' 'What's that you say?' replied Fouque. 'I ask you if you have any Constitutionnels?' Julien repeated, in a calmer tone. 'They are sold here for thirty sous a copy.' 'What! Liberals even in the Seminary!' cried Fouque. 'Unhappy France!' he went on, copying the hypocritical tone and meek accents of the abbe Maslon. This visit would have made a profound impression upon our hero, had not, the very next day, a remark addressed to him by that little sem- inarist from Verrieres who seemed such a boy, led him to make an im- portant discovery. Ever since he had been in the Seminary, Julien's con- duct had been nothing but a succession of false steps. He laughed bit- terly at himself. As a matter of fact, the important actions of his life were wisely ordered; but he paid no attention to details, and the clever people in a Seminary look only at details. And so he passed already among his

fellow students as a free thinker. He had been betrayed by any number of trifling actions. In their eyes he was convicted of this appalling vice, he thought, he judged for himself, instead of blindly following authority and example. The abbe Pirard had been of no assistance to him; he had not once uttered a word to him apart from the tribunal of penitence, and even there he listened rather than spoke. It would have been very different had Julien chosen the abbe Castanede. The moment that Julien became aware of his own folly, his interest re- vived. He wished to know the whole extent of the harm, and, with this object, emerged a little from that haughty and obstinate silence with which he repulsed his fellows. It was then that they took their revenge on him. His advances were received with a contempt which went the length of derision. He realised that since his entering the Seminary, not an hour had passed, especially during recreation, that had not borne some consequence for or against him, had not increased the number of his enemies, or won him the good will of some seminarist who was genuinely virtuous or a trifle less boorish than the rest. The damage to be repaired was immense, the task one of great difficulty. Thenceforward Julien's attention was constantly on the alert; it was a case of portraying himself in an entirely new character. The control of his eyes, for instance, gave him a great deal of trouble. It is not without reason that in such places they are kept lowered. 'What was not my presumption at Verrieres!' Julien said to himself, 'I imagined I was alive; I was only preparing myself for life; here I am at last in the world, as I shall find it until I have played out my part, surrounded by real enemies. What an immense difficulty,' he went on, 'is this incessant hypocrisy! It would put the labours of Hercules to shame. The Hercules of modern times is Sixtus V, who for fifteen years on end, by his mod- esty, deceived forty Cardinals, who had seen him proud and vigorous in his youth. 'So learning is really nothing here!' he told himself with scorn; 'progress in dogma, in sacred history, and the rest of it, count only in ap- pearance. All that is said on that topic is intended to make fools like my- self fall into the trap. Alas, my sole merit consisted in my rapid progress, in my faculty for grasping all that nonsense. Can it be that in their hearts they esteem it at its true value; judge of it as I do? And I was fool enough to be proud of myself! Those first places in class which I always obtain have served only to give me bitter enemies. Chazel, who knows far more than I, always puts into his compositions some piece of stupidity which

sends him down to the fiftieth place; if he obtains the first, it is when he is not thinking. Ah! one word, a single word from M. Pirard, how useful it would have been to me!' > From the moment in which Julien's eyes were opened, the long exer- cises of ascetic piety, such as the Rosary five times weekly, the hymns to the Sacred Heart, etc., etc., which had seemed to him of such deadly dull- ness, became the most interesting actions of his life. Sternly criticising his own conduct, and seeking above all not to exaggerate his methods, Julien did not aspire from the first, like the seminarists who served as models to the rest, to perform at every moment some significant action, that is to say one which gave proof of some form of Christian perfection. In Sem- inaries, there is a way of eating a boiled egg which reveals the progress one has made in the godly life. The reader, who is perhaps smiling, will please to remember all the mistakes made, in eating an egg, by the abbe Delille when invited to luncheon by a great lady of the Court of Louis XVI. Julien sought at first to arrive at the non culpa, to wit, the state of the young seminarist whose gait, his way of moving his arms, eyes, etc., do not, it is true, indicate anything worldly, but do not yet show the creature absorbed by the idea of the next life and the absolute nullity of this. Everywhere Julien found inscribed in charcoal, on the walls of the pas- sages, sentences like the following: 'What are sixty years of trial, set in the balance with an eternity of bliss or an eternity of boiling oil in hell!' He no longer despised them; he realised that he must have them always before his eyes. 'What shall I be doing all my life?' he said to himself; 'I shall be selling the faithful a place in heaven. How is that place to be made visible to them? By the difference between my exterior and that of a layman.' After several months of application kept up at every moment, Julien still had the air of a thinker. His way of moving his eyes and opening his lips did not reveal an implicit faith ready to believe everything and to uphold everything, even by martyrdom. It was with anger that Julien saw himself surpassed in this respect by the most boorish peasants. They had good reasons for not having the air of thinkers. What pains did he not take to arrive at that expression of blind and fervent faith, which is so frequently to be found in the convents of Italy, and such perfect examples of which Guercino has bequeathed to us lay- men in his paintings in churches. 4

On the greatest festivals the seminarists were given sausages with pickled cabbage. Julien's neighbours at table observed that he remained unmoved by this good fortune; it was one of his first crimes. His com- rades saw in it an odious mark of the most stupid hypocrisy; nothing made him so many enemies. 'Look at that gentleman, look at that proud fellow,' they would say, 'pretending to despise our best ration, sausages with cabbage! The wretched conceit of the damned fellow!' He should have refrained as an act of penance from eating the whole of his portion, and should have made the sacrifice of saying to some friend, with refer- ence to the pickled cabbage: 'What is there that man can offer to an All Powerful Being, if it be not voluntary suffering?' Julien lacked the experience which makes it so easy for us to see things of this sort. 'Alas! The ignorance of these young peasants, my comrades, is a great advantage to them,' Julien would exclaim in moments of discourage- ment. 'When they arrive in the Seminary, the teacher has not to rid them of the appalling number of worldly thoughts which I brought with me, and which they read on my face, do what I will.' Julien studied with an attention that bordered upon envy the more boorish of the young peasants who arrived at the Seminary. At the mo- ment when they were stripped of their ratteen jackets to be garbed in the black cassock, their education was limited to an immense and unboun- ded respect for dry and liquid money, as the saying goes in the Franche- Comte. It is the sacramental and heroic fashion of expressing the sublime idea of ready cash. Happiness, for these seminarists, as for the heroes of Voltaire's tales, consists first and foremost in dining well. Julien discovered in almost all of them an innate respect for the man who wears a coat of fine cloth. This sentiment estimates distributive justice, as it is dealt out to us by our courts, at its true worth, indeed below its true worth. 'What is to be gained,' they would often say among themselves, 'by going to law with the big?' 'Big' is the word used in the valleys of the Jura to denote a rich man. One may imagine their respect for the richest party of all: the Government! 4.For instance, in the Louvre, no. 1130: 'Francis Duke of Aquitaine laying aside the crown and putting on a monastic habit.'

Not to smile respectfully at the mere name of the Prefect is reckoned, among the peasants of the Franche-Comte, an imprudence; and im- prudence, among the poor, is promptly punished with want of bread. After having been almost suffocated at first by his sense of scorn, Juli- en ended by feeling pity: it had often been the lot of the fathers of the majority of his comrades to come home on a winter evening to their cot- tages, and to find there no bread, no chestnuts, and no potatoes. 'Is it sur- prising then,' Julien asked himself, 'if the happy man, in their eyes, is first of all the man who has just eaten a good dinner, and after that he who possesses a good coat! My comrades have a definite vocation; that is to say, they see in the ecclesiastical calling a long continuation of this hap- piness: dining well and having a warm coat in winter.' Julien happened to hear a young seminarist, endowed with imagina- tion, say to his companion: 'Why should not I become Pope like Sixtus v, who was a swineherd?' 'They make none but Italians Popes,' replied the friend; 'but they'll draw lots among us, for sure, to fill places as Vicars-General and Canons, and perhaps Bishops. M. P—— the Bishop of Chalons, is the son of a cooper; that is my father's trade.' One day, in the middle of a lesson in dogma, the abbe Pirard sent for Julien. The poor young fellow was delighted to escape from the physical and moral atmosphere in which he was plunged. Julien found himself greeted by the Director in the manner which had so frightened him on the day of his joining the Seminary. 'Explain to me what I see written upon this playing card,' he said to him, looking at him in such a way as to make him wish that the earth would open and swallow him. Julien read: 'Amanda Binet, at the Giraffe cafe, before eight o'clock. Say you are from Genlis, and a cousin of my mother.' Julien perceived the immensity of the danger; the abbe Castanede's po- lice had stolen the address from him. 'The day on which I came here,' he replied, gazing at the abbe Pirard's forehead, for he could not face his terrible eye, 'I was trembling with fear: M. Chelan had told me that this was a place full of tale-bearing and spite of all sorts; spying and the accusation of one's comrades are encouraged here. Such is the will of heaven, to show life as it is to young priests, and to inspire in them a disgust with the world and its pomps.' 'And it is to me that you make these fine speeches'—the abbe Pirard was furious. 'You young rascal!'

'At Verrieres,' Julien went on calmly, 'my brothers used to beat me when they had any reason to be jealous of me ... ' 'To the point! Get to the point!' cried M. Pirard, almost beside himself. Without being the least bit in the world intimidated, Julien resumed his narrative. 'On the day of my coming to Besancon, about noon, I felt hungry, I went into a cafe. My heart was filled with repugnance for so profane a spot; but I thought that my luncheon would cost me less there than at an inn. A lady, who seemed to be the mistress of the place, took pity on my raw looks. "Besancon is full of wicked people," she told me, "I am afraid for you, Sir. If you find yourself in any trouble, come to me, send a mes- sage to me before eight o'clock. If the porters at the Seminary refuse to take your message, say that you are my cousin, and come from Genlis ... "' 'All this farrago will have to be investigated,' exclaimed the abbe Pir- ard who, unable to remain in one place, was striding up and down the room. 'You will go back to your cell!' The abbe accompanied Julien and locked him in. He himself at once proceeded to examine his trunk, in the bottom of which the fatal card had been carefully concealed. Nothing was missing from the trunk, but several things had been disarranged; and yet the key never left his pos- session. 'How fortunate,' Julien said to himself, 'that during the time of my blindness I never made use of the permission to leave the building, which M. Castanede so frequently offered me with a generosity which I now understand. Perhaps I might have been so foolish as to change my clothes and pay the fair Amanda a visit, I should have been ruined. When they despaired of making any use of their information in that way, so as not to waste it they have used it to denounce me. A couple of hours later, the Director sent for him. 'You have not lied,' he said to him, looking at him less severely; 'but to keep such an address is an imprudence the serious nature of which you cannot conceive. Unhappy boy! In ten years, perhaps, it will redound to your hurt.'

Chapter First Experience of Life The present moment, by God! is the ark of the Lord. Woe betide the man who lays his hand upon it. DIDEROT The reader will kindly excuse our giving but few clear and precise de- tails of this epoch in Julien's life. Not that we lack them, far from it; but perhaps the life he led in the Seminary is too black for the modest colour- ing which we have sought to preserve in these pages. People who have been made to suffer by certain things cannot be reminded of them without a horror which paralyses every other pleasure, even that to be found in reading a story. Julien met with little success in his attempts at hypocrisy in action; he passed through moments of disgust and even of complete discourage- ment. He was utterly unsuccessful, and that moreover in a vile career. The slightest help from without would have sufficed to restore his mor- ale, the difficulty to be overcome was not great; but he was alone, as lonely as a vessel abandoned in mid-ocean. 'And if I should succeed,' he said to himself; 'to have to spend my whole life in such evil company! Gluttons who think of nothing but the ham omelette they are going to devour at dinner, or men like the abbe Castanede, to whom no crime is too black! They will rise to power; but at what a price, great God! 'Man's will is powerful, I see it written everywhere; but is it suffi- ciently so to overcome such repulsion? The task of great men has always been easy; however terrible was their danger, it was beautiful in their eyes; and who but myself can realise the ugliness of all that surrounds me?' This was the most trying moment in his life. It was so easy for him to enlist in one of the fine regiments that were stationed at Besancon! He might become a teacher of Latin; he wanted so little to keep himself alive! But then, no career, no future for his imagination: it was a living death. Here is a detailed account of one of his wretched days.

'My presumption has so often flattered itself upon my being different from the other young peasants! Well, I have lived long enough to see that difference breeds hatred,' he said to himself one morning. This great truth had just been revealed to him by one of his most annoying failures. He had laboured for a week to make himself agreeable to a student who lived in the odour of sanctity. He was walking with him in the courtyard, listening submissively to idiocies that sent him to sleep as he walked. Suddenly a storm broke, the thunder growled, and the saintly student exclaimed, thrusting him rudely away: 'Listen, each for himself in this world, I have no wish to be struck by lightning: God may blast you as an infidel, another Voltaire.' His teeth clenched with rage and his eyes opened towards the sky fur- rowed by streaks of lightning: 'I should deserve to be submerged, were I to let myself sleep during the storm!' cried Julien. 'Let us attempt the con- quest of some other drudge.' The bell rang for the abbe Castanede's class of sacred history. These young peasants who lived in such fear of the hard toil and poverty of their fathers, were taught that day by the abbe Castanede that that being so terrible in their eyes, the Government, had no real or legit- imate power save what was delegated to it by God's Vicar on Earth. 'Render yourselves worthy of the Pope's bounties by the sanctity of your lives, by your obedience, be like a rod in his hands,' he went on, 'and you will attain to a superb position where you will be in supreme command, under no man's control; a permanent position, of which the Government pays one third of the emoluments, and the faithful, roused by your preaching, the other two thirds.' On leaving his classroom, M. Castanede stopped in the courtyard. 'You may well say of a cure, each man gets what he deserves,' he said to the students who gathered round him. 'I myself have known moun- tain parishes where the fees came to more than those of many town cures. There was as much in money, not to speak of the fat capons, eggs, fresh butter, and endless little delicacies; and there the cure takes the first place without challenge: no good meal to which he is not invited, made much of,' etc. No sooner had M. Castanede gone up to his own room, than the stu- dents divided into groups. Julien belonged to none of these; they drew away from him as from a tainted wether. In each of the groups, he saw a student toss a copper in the air, and if he guessed head or tail aright, his companions concluded that he would soon have one of these livings with fat fees.

Stories followed. One young priest, barely a year in orders, having presented a domestic rabbit to an old cure's servant, had got the cure to ask for him as his assistant, and a few months afterwards, for the cure had died almost immediately, had succeeded him in a good living. Another had managed to have his name put forward for the eventual succession to the curacy of a prosperous country town, by attending all the meals of the paralytic old cure and carving his chickens for him gracefully. The seminarists, like young men in every profession, exaggerated the effect of these little stratagems when they were out of the ordinary and struck the imagination. 'I must,' thought Julien, 'take part in these conversations.' When they were not discussing sausages and rich livings, their talk ran on the worldly side of ecclesiastical teaching; the differences between Bishops and Prefects, mayors and cures. Julien saw lurking in their minds the idea of a second God, but of a God far more to be feared and far more powerful than the first; this second God was the Pope. It was said, but with lowered voice, and when the speaker was quite certain of not being overheard by M. Pirard, that if the Pope did not take the trouble to ap- point all the Prefects and all the mayors in France, it was because he had delegated the King of France for that duty, by naming him the Eldest Son of the Church. It was about this time that Julien thought he might derive some benefit from his admiration for M. de Maistre's book on the Pope. He did, as a matter of fact, astonish his fellow-students; but this was a fresh misfor- tune. He annoyed them by expressing their opinions better than they could themselves. M. Chelan had been a rash counsellor for Julien as he had been for himself. After training him to the habit of reasoning accur- ately and not letting himself be taken in by vain words, he had omitted to tell him that in a person of little repute this habit is a crime; for sound reasoning always gives offence. Julien's fine speech was therefore only another crime against him. His companions, being compelled to think about him, succeeded in finding two words to express all the horror with which he filled them: they nick- named him Martin Luther; 'chiefly,' they said, 'because of that infernal logic of which he is so proud.' Several young seminarists had fresher complexions and might be reckoned better looking than Julien; but he had white hands, and could not hide certain habits of personal cleanliness. This distinction was none at all in the grim dwelling into which destiny had cast him. The unclean

peasants among whom he lived declared that he had extremely lax mor- als. We are afraid to tire the reader by an account of our hero's endless mishaps. To take one instance, the more vigorous among his companions tried to make a practice of thrashing him; he was obliged to arm himself with a metal compass and to inform them, but only by signs, that he would use it. Signs cannot be represented, in a spy's report, so damningly as words.

Chapter A Procession All hearts were moved. God's presence seemed to have come down into these narrow, gothic streets, decked on every side, and strewn with sand through the good offices of the faithful. YOUNG 5 In vain might Julien make himself small and foolish, he could not give satisfaction, he was too different. 'And yet,' he said to himself, 'all these Professors are men of great discernment, and picked men, each of them one in a thousand; how is it they do not like my humility?' One alone seemed to him to be taking advantage of his readiness to believe any- thing and to appear taken in by everything. This was the abbe Chas- Bernard, Master of Ceremonies at the Cathedral, where, for the last fif- teen years, he had been kept in hopes of a Canonry; in the meantime, he taught sacred eloquence at the Seminary. In the period of his blindness, this class was one of those in which Julien most regularly came out at the top. The abbe Chas had been led by this to show a partiality for him, and, at the end of his class, would gladly take his arm for a turn in the garden. 'What can his object be?' Julien asked himself. He found with amazement that, for hours on end, the abbe talked to him of the orna- ments which the Cathedral possessed. It had seventeen apparelled chas- ubles, apart from the vestments worn at requiems. They had great hopes of President de Rubempre's widow; this lady, who was ninety years old, had preserved for at least seventy of those years her wedding garments of superb Lyons stuffs, figured in gold. 'Just imagine, my friend,' said the abbe Chas coming to a standstill and opening his eyes wide, 'these stuffs stand by themselves, there is so much gold in them. It is common opin- ion in Besancon that, under the Presidente's will, the treasury of the Cathedral will be enriched with more than ten chasubles, not to mention four or five copes for the greater feasts. I will go farther,' the abbe Chas 5.As in Chapter 26 I have left this motto in French. It seems, however, to be taken from Arthur Young rather and Edward. C. K. S. M.

added, lowering his voice. 'I have good reason to think that the Presid- ente will bequeath to us eight magnificent silver-gilt candlesticks, which are supposed to have been bought in Italy, by the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold, whose favourite minister was an ancestor of hers.' 'But what is this man really aiming at behind all this frippery?' Julien wondered. 'This careful preparation has been going on for an age, and nothing comes of it. He must have singularly little faith in me! He is cleverer than any of the others, whose secret purposes one can see so plainly after a fortnight. I understand, this man's ambition has been in torment for fifteen years.' One evening, in the middle of the armed drill, Julien was sent for by the abbe Pirard, who said to him: 'Tomorrow is the feast of Corpus Christi. M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard re- quires you to help him to decorate the Cathedral; go and obey.' The abbe Pirard called him back, and added, in a tone of compassion: 'It is for you to decide whether you wish to seize the opportunity of taking a stroll through the town.' 'Incedo per ignes,' replied Julien: which is to say, I am treading on dan- gerous ground. Next morning at daybreak, Julien made his way to the Cathedral, walking with lowered eyes. The sight of the streets and the activity which was beginning to pervade the town did him good. On every side people were draping the fronts of their houses for the procession. All the time that he had spent in the Seminary seemed to him no more than an instant. His thoughts were at Vergy, and with that charming Amanda Binet, whom he might meet, for her cafe was but little out of his way. He saw in the distance the abbe Chas-Bernard, standing by the door of his beloved Cathedral; he was a large man with a joyful countenance and an open air. This morning he was triumphant: 'I have been waiting for you, my dear son,' he called out, as soon as he caught sight of Julien, 'you are welcome. Our labours this day will be long and hard, let us fortify ourselves with an early breakfast; the other we shall take at ten o'clock during high mass.' 'I desire, Sir,' Julien said to him with an air of gravity, 'not to be left alone for a moment; kindly observe,' he added, pointing to the clock above their heads, 'that I have arrived at one minute before five.' 'Ah! So you are afraid of those young rascals at the Seminary! It is too kind of you to give them a thought,' said the abbe Chas; 'is a road any the worse, because there are thorns in the hedges on either side of it? The

traveller goes his way and leaves the wicked thorns to wither where they are. However, we must to work, my dear friend, to work.' The abbe Chas had been right in saying that their labours would be hard. There had been a great funeral service in the Cathedral the day be- fore; it had been impossible to make any preparations; they were ob- liged, therefore, in the course of the morning, to drape each of the gothic pillars which separate the nave from the aisles in a sort of jacket of red damask which rose to a height of thirty feet. The Bishop had ordered four decorators from Paris by mail coach, but these gentlemen could not do everything themselves, and so far from encouraging the awkward ef- forts of their Bisontine colleagues they increased their awkwardness by laughing at it. Julien saw that he would have to go up the ladders himself, his agility stood him in good stead. He undertook to direct the local decorators in person. The abbe Chas was in ecstasies as he watched him spring from one ladder to another. When all the pillars were hung with damask, the next thing was to go and place five enormous bunches of plumes on top of the great baldachino, over the high altar. A richly gilded wooden crown was supported on eight great twisted columns of Italian marble. But, in order to reach the centre of the baldachino, over the tabernacle, one had to step across an old wooden cornice, possibly worm-eaten, and forty feet from the ground. The sight of this perilous ascent had extinguished the gaiety, so bril- liant until then, of the Parisian decorators; they looked at it from beneath, discussed it volubly, and did not go up. Julien took possession of the bunches of plumes, and ran up the ladder. He arranged them admirably upon the ornament in the form of a crown in the centre of the bal- dachino. As he stepped down from the ladder, the abbe Chas-Bernard took him in his arms. 'Optime!' exclaimed the worthy priest, 'I shall tell Monseigneur of this.' Their ten o'clock breakfast was a merry feast. Never had the abbe Chas seen his church looking so well. 'My dear disciple,' he said to Julien, 'my mother used to hire out chairs in this venerable fane, so that I was brought up in this great edifice. Robespierre's Terror ruined us; but, at eight years old, as I then was, I was already serving masses in private houses, and their owners gave me my dinner on mass days. No one could fold a chasuble better than I, the gold braid was never broken. Since the restoration of the Faith by Napo- leon, it has been my happy lot to take charge of everything in this vener- able mother church. On five days in the year, my eyes behold it decked

out with these beautiful ornaments. But never has it been so resplendent, never have the damask strips been so well hung as they are today, have they clung so to the pillars.' 'At last, he is going to tell me his secret,' thought Julien, 'here he is talk- ing to me of himself; he is beginning to expand.' But nothing imprudent was said by this man, evidently in an excited state. 'And yet he has worked hard, he is happy,' Julien said to himself, 'the good wine has not been spared. What a man! What an example for me! He takes the prize.' (This was a low expression which he had picked up from the old surgeon.) When the Sanctus bell rang during high mass, Julien wished to put on a surplice so as to follow the Bishop in the superb procession. 'And the robbers, my friend, the robbers!' cried the abbe Chas, 'you forget them. The procession is going out; the church will be left empty; we must keep watch, you and I. We shall be fortunate if we lose only a couple of ells of that fine braid which goes round the base of the pillars. That is another gift from Madame de Rubempre; it comes from the fam- ous Count, her great-grandfather; it is pure gold, my friend,' the abbe went on, whispering in his ear, and with an air of evident exaltation, 'nothing false about it! I entrust to you the inspection of the north aisle, do not stir from it. I keep for myself the south aisle and nave. Keep an eye on the confessionals; it is there that the robbers' women spies watch for the moment when our backs are turned.' As he finished speaking, the quarter before twelve struck, at once the big bell began to toll. It was being pulled with all the ringers' might; the rich and solemn sound stirred Julien deeply. His imagination rose from the ground. The odour of the incense and of the rose leaves strewn before the Blessed Sacrament by children dressed as little Saint Johns, intensified his excitement. The sober note of the bell ought to have suggested to Julien only the thought of the work of a score of men earning fifty centimes, and as- sisted perhaps by fifteen or twenty of the faithful. He ought to have thought of the wear and tear of the ropes, of the timber, of the danger from the bell itself which fell every two hundred years, and to have planned some way of diminishing the wage of the ringers, or of paying them with some indulgence or other favour drawn from the spiritual treasury of the Church, with no strain upon her purse. In place of these sage reflections, Julien's soul, excited by these rich and virile sounds, was straying through imaginary space. Never will he

make either a good priest or a great administrator. Souls that are moved thus are capable at most of producing an artist. Here Julien's presump- tion breaks out in the full light of day. Fifty, perhaps, of his fellow semin- arists, made attentive to the realities of life by the public hatred and Ja- cobinism which, they are told, is lurking behind every hedge, on hearing the big bell of the Cathedral, would have thought only of the wages paid to the ringers. They would have applied the genius of a Bareme to de- termine the question whether the degree of emotion aroused in the pub- lic was worth the money given to the ringers. Had Julien chosen to give his mind to the material interests of the Cathedral, his imagination flying beyond its goal would have thought of saving forty francs for the Chapter, and would have let slip the opportunity of avoiding an outlay of twenty-five centimes. While, in the most perfect weather ever seen, the procession wound its way slowly through Besancon, and halted at the glittering stations which all the local authorities had vied with one another in erecting, the church remained wrapped in a profound silence. A suffused light, an agreeable coolness reigned in it; it was still balmy with the fragrance of flowers and incense. The silence, the profound solitude, the coolness of the long aisles, made Julien's musings all the sweeter. He had no fear of being disturbed by the abbe Chas, who was occupied in another part of the building. His soul had almost quitted its mortal envelope, which was strolling at a slow pace along the north aisle committed to his charge. He was all the more at rest, since he was certain that there was nobody in the confes- sionals save a few devout women; he saw without observing. His distraction was nevertheless half conquered by the sight of two women extremely well dressed who were kneeling, one of them in a con- fessional, the other, close beside her, upon a chair. He saw without ob- serving them; at the same time, whether from a vague sense of his duty, or from admiration of the plain but noble attire of these ladies, he re- marked that there was no priest in that confessional. 'It is strange,' he thought, 'that these beautiful ladies are not kneeling before some station, if they are religious; or placed in good seats in the front of some balcony, if they are fashionable. How well cut that gown is! What grace!' He slackened his pace in order to see their faces. The one who was kneeling in the confessional turned her head slightly on hearing the sound of Julien's step amid the prevailing silence. All at once she gave a little cry, and fainted.

As her strength left her, this kneeling lady fell back; her friend, who was close at hand, hastened to the rescue. At the same time Julien caught sight of the shoulders of the lady who had fallen back. A rope of large seed pearls, well known to him, caught his eye. What was his state when he recognised the hair of Madame de Renal! It was she. The lady who was trying to hold up her head, and to arrest her fall, was Madame Derville. Julien, beside himself with emotion, sprang forward; Madame de Renal's fall would perhaps have brought down her friend if he had not supported them. He saw Madame de Renal's head, pale, absolutely devoid of consciousness, drooping upon her shoulder. He helped Ma- dame Derville to prop that charming head against the back of a straw chair; he was on his knees. Madame Derville turned and recognised him. 'Fly, Sir, fly!' she said to him in accents of the most burning anger. 'On no account must she see you again. The sight of you must indeed fill her with horror, she was so happy before you came! Your behaviour is atro- cious. Fly; be off with you, if you have any shame left.' This speech was uttered with such authority, and Julien felt so weak at the moment, that he withdrew. 'She always hated me,' he said to himself, thinking of Madame Derville. At that moment, the nasal chant of the leading priests in the proces- sion rang through the church; the procession was returning. The abbe Chas-Bernard called repeatedly to Julien, who at first did not hear him: finally he came and led him by the arm from behind a pillar where Julien had taken refuge more dead than alive. He wished to present him to the Bishop. 'You are feeling unwell, my child,' said the abbe, seeing him so pale and almost unable to walk; 'you have been working too hard.' The abbe gave him his arm. 'Come, sit down here, on the sacristan's little stool, be- hind me; I shall screen you.' They were now by the side of the main door. 'Calm yourself, we have still a good twenty minutes before Monseigneur appears. Try to recover yourself; when he passes, I shall hold you up, for I am strong and vigorous, in spite of my age.' But when the Bishop passed, Julien was so tremulous that the abbe Chas abandoned the idea of presenting him. 'Do not worry yourself about it,' he told him, 'I shall find another opportunity.' That evening, he sent down to the chapel of the Seminary ten pounds of candles, saved, he said, by Julien's efforts and the rapidity with which he extinguished them. Nothing could have been farther from the truth.

The poor boy was himself extinguished; he had not had a thought in his head after seeing Madame de Renal.

Chapter The First Step He knew his times, he knew his departement, and he is rich. Le Precurseur Julien had not yet recovered from the profound abstraction in which the incident in the Cathedral had plunged him, when one morning the grim abbe Pirard sent for him. 'Here is M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard writing to me to commend you. I am quite satisfied with your conduct as a whole. You are extremely im- prudent and indeed stupid, without showing it; however, up to the present your heart is sound and even generous; your intellect is above the average. Taking you all in all, I see a spark in you which must not be neglected. 'After fifteen years of labour, I am on the eve of leaving this establish- ment: my crime is that of having allowed the seminarists to use their own judgment, and of having neither protected nor unmasked that secret society of which you have spoken to me at the stool of penitence. Before I go, I wish to do something for you; I should have acted two months ago, for you deserve it, but for the accusation based upon the ad- dress of Amanda Binet, which was found in your possession. I appoint you tutor in the New and Old Testaments.' Julien, in a transport of gratitude, quite thought of falling on his knees and thanking God; but he yielded to a more genuine impulse. He went up to the abbe Pirard and took his hand, which he raised to his lips. 'What is this?' cried the Director in a tone of annoyance; but Julien's eyes were even more eloquent than his action. The abbe Pirard gazed at him in astonishment, like a man who, in the course of long years, has fallen out of the way of meeting with delicate emotions. This attention pierced the Director's armour; his voice changed. 'Ah, well! Yes, my child, I am attached to you. Heaven knows that it is entirely against my will. I ought to be just, and to feel neither hatred nor

love for anyone. Your career will be difficult. I see in you something that offends the common herd. Jealousy and calumny will pursue you. In whatever place Providence may set you, your companions will never set eyes on you without hating you; and if they pretend to love you, it will be in order to betray you the more surely. For this there is but one rem- edy: have recourse only to God, who has given you, to punish you for your presumption, this necessity of being hated; let your conduct be pure; that is the sole resource that I can see for you. If you hold fast to the truth with an invincible embrace, sooner or later your enemies will be put to confusion." It was so long since Julien had heard a friendly voice, that we must forgive him a weakness: he burst into tears. The abbe Pirard opened his arms to embrace him; the moment was very precious to them both. Julien was wild with joy; this promotion was the first that he had ob- tained; the advantages were immense. In order to realise them, one must have been condemned to pass whole months without a moment's solitude, and in immediate contact with companions at best tiresome, and mostly intolerable. Their shouts alone would have been enough to create disorder in a sensitive organism. The boisterous joy of these peas- ants well fed and well dressed, could find expression, thought itself com- plete only when they were shouting with the full force of their lungs. Now Julien dined by himself, or almost so, an hour later than the rest of the seminarists. He had a key to the garden, and might walk there at the hours when it was empty. Greatly to his surprise, Julien noticed that they hated him less; he had been expecting, on the contrary, an intensification of their hatred. That secret desire that no one should speak to him, which was all too appar- ent and had made him so many enemies, was no longer a sign of absurd pride. In the eyes of the coarse beings among whom he lived, it was a proper sense of his own dignity. Their hatred diminished perceptibly, es- pecially among the youngest of his companions, now become his pupils, whom he treated with great courtesy. In course of time he had even sup- porters; it became bad form to call him Martin Luther. But why speak of his friends, his enemies? It is all so ugly, and all the more ugly, the more accurately it is drawn from life. These are however the only teachers of ethics that the people have, and without them where should we be? Will the newspaper ever manage to take the place of the parish priest? Since Julien's promotion, the Director of the Seminary made a point of never speaking to him except in the presence of witnesses. This was only

prudent, in the master's interest as well as the pupil's; but more than anything else it was a test. The stern Jansenist Pirard's invariable prin- ciple was: 'Has a man any merit in your eyes? Place an obstacle in the way of everything that he desires, everything that he undertakes. If his merit be genuine, he will certainly be able to surmount or thrust aside your obstacles.' It was the hunting season. Fouque took it into his head to send to the Seminary a stag and a boar in the name of Julien's family. The dead an- imals were left lying in the passage, between kitchen and refectory. There all the seminarists saw them on their way to dinner. They aroused much interest. The boar, although stone dead, frightened the younger boys; they fingered his tusks. Nothing else was spoken of for a week. This present, which classified Julien's family in the section of society that one must respect, dealt a mortal blow to jealousy. It was a form of superiority consecrated by fortune. Chazel and the most distinguished of the seminarists made overtures to him, and almost complained to him that he had not warned them of his parents' wealth, and had thus be- trayed them into showing a want of respect for money. There was a conscription from which Julien was exempt in his capacity as a seminarist. This incident moved him deeply. 'And so there has passed now for ever the moment at which, twenty years ago, a heroic life would have begun for me!' Walking by himself in the Seminary garden, he overheard a conversa- tion between two masons who were at work upon the enclosing wall. 'Ah, well! One will have to go, here's another conscription.' In the other man's days, well and good! A stone mason became an of- ficer, and became a general, that has been known.' 'Look what it's like now! Only the beggars go. A man with the where- withal stays at home.' 'The man who is born poor stays poor, and that's all there is to it.' 'Tell me, now, is it true what people say, that the other is dead?' put in a third mason. 'It's the big ones who say that, don't you see? They were afraid of the other.' 'What a difference, how well everything went in his time! And to think that he was betrayed by his Marshals! There must always be a traitor somewhere!' This conversation comforted Julien a little. As he walked away he re- peated to himself with a sigh: 'The only King whose memory the people cherish still!'

The examinations came round. Julien answered the questions in a bril- liant manner; he saw that Chazel himself was seeking to display the whole extent of his knowledge. On the first day, the examiners appointed by the famous Vicar-General de Frilair greatly resented having always to place first, or at the very most second on their list this Julien Sorel who had been pointed out to them as the favourite of the abbe Pirard. Wagers were made in the Sem- inary that in the aggregate list of the examinations, Julien would occupy the first place, a distinction that carried with it the honour of dining with the Bishop. But at the end of one session, in which the subject had been the Fathers of the Church, a skilful examiner, after questioning Julien upon Saint Jerome, and his passion for Cicero, began to speak of Horace, Virgil and other profane authors. Unknown to his companions, Julien had learned by heart a great number of passages from these authors. Carried away by his earlier successes, he forgot where he was and, at the repeated request of the examiner, recited and paraphrased with enthusi- asm several odes of Horace. Having let him sink deeper and deeper for twenty minutes, suddenly the examiner's face changed, and he delivered a stinging rebuke to Julien for having wasted his time in these profane studies, and stuffed his head with useless if not criminal thoughts. 'I am a fool, Sir, and you are right,' said Julien with a modest air, as he saw the clever stratagem by which he had been taken in. This ruse on the examiner's part was considered a dirty trick, even in the Seminary, though this did not prevent M. l'abbe de Frilair, that clever man, who had so ably organised the framework of the Bisontine Congreg- ation, and whose reports to Paris made judges, prefect, and even the gen- eral officers of the garrison tremble, from setting, with his powerful hand, the number 198 against Julien's name. He was delighted thus to mortify his enemy, the Jansenist Pirard. For the last ten years his great ambition had been to remove Pirard from control of the Seminary. That cleric, following in his own conduct the principles which he had outlined to Julien, was sincere, devout, inno- cent of intrigue, devoted to his duty. But heaven, in its wrath, had given him that splenetic temperament, bound to feel deeply insults and hatred. Not one of the affronts that were put upon him was lost upon his ardent spirit. He would have offered his resignation a hundred times, but he be- lieved that he was of use in the post in which Providence had placed him. 'I prevent the spread of Jesuitry and idolatry,' he used to say to himself.

At the time of the examinations, it was perhaps two months since he had spoken to Julien, and yet he was ill for a week, when, on receiving the official letter announcing the result of the competition, he saw the number 198 set against the name of that pupil whom he regarded as the glory of his establishment. The only consolation for this stern character was to concentrate upon Julien all the vigilance at his command. He was delighted to find in him neither anger nor thoughts of revenge, nor discouragement. Some weeks later, Julien shuddered on receiving a letter; it bore the Paris postmark. 'At last,' he thought, 'Madame de Renal has remembered her promises.' A gentleman who signed himself Paul Sorel, and pro- fessed to be related to him, sent him a bill of exchange for five hundred francs. The writer added that if Julien continued to study with success the best Latin authors, a similar sum would be sent to him every year. 'It is she, it is her bounty!' Julien said to himself with emotion, 'she wishes to comfort me; but why is there not one word of affection?' He was mistaken with regard to the letter; Madame de Renal, under the influence of her friend Madame Derville, was entirely absorbed in her own profound remorse. In spite of herself, she often thought of the strange creature whose coming into her life had so upset it, but she would never have dreamed of writing to him. If we spoke the language of the Seminary, we might see a miracle in this windfall of five hundred francs, and say that it was M. de Frilair himself that heaven had employed to make this gift to Julien. Twelve years earlier, M. l'abbe de Frilair had arrived at Besancon with the lightest of portmanteaux, which, the story went, contained his entire fortune. He now found himself one of the wealthiest landowners in the Department. In the course of his growing prosperity he had purchased one half of an estate of which the other half passed by inheritance to M. de La Mole. Hence a great lawsuit between these worthies. Despite his brilliant existence in Paris, and the posts which he held at court, the Marquis de La Mole felt that it was dangerous to fight down at Besancon against a Vicar-General who was reputed to make and unmake Prefects. Instead of asking for a gratuity of fifty thousand francs, dis- guised under some head or other that would pass in the budget, and al- lowing M. de Frilair to win this pettifogging action for fifty thousand francs, the Marquis took offence. He believed that he had a case: a fine reason! For, if we may be so bold as to say it: what judge is there who has not a son, or at least a cousin to help on in the world?

To enlighten the less clear-sighted, a week after the first judgment that he obtained, M. l'abbe de Frilair took the Bishop's carriage, and went in person to convey the Cross of the Legion of Honour to his counsel. M. de La Mole, somewhat dismayed by the bold front assumed by the other side, and feeling that his own counsel were weakening, asked the advice of the abbe Chelan, who put him in touch with M. Pirard. At the date of our story they had been corresponding thus for some years. The abbe Pirard dashed into the business with all the force of his passionate nature. In constant communication with the Marquis's coun- sel, he studied his case, and finding him to be in the right, openly de- clared himself a partisan of the Marquis de La Mole against the all powerful Vicar-General. The latter was furious at such insolence, and coming from a little Jansenist to boot! 'You see what these court nobles are worth who claim to have such power!' the abbe de Frilair would say to his intimates; 'M. de La Mole has not sent so much as a wretched Cross to his agent at Besancon, and is go- ing to allow him to be deprived of his post without a murmur. And yet, my friends write to me, this noble peer never allows a week to pass without going to show off his blue riband in the drawing-room of the Keeper of the Seals, for what that is worth.' In spite of all M. Pirard's activity, and albeit M. de La Mole was always on the best of terms with the Minister of Justice and still more with his officials, all that he had been able to achieve, after six years of constant effort, was to avoid actually losing his case. In ceaseless correspondence with the abbe Pirard, over an affair which they both pursued with passion, the Marquis came in time to appreciate the abbe's type of mind. Gradually, despite the immense gulf between their social positions, their correspondence took on a tone of friendship. The abbe Pirard told the Marquis that his enemies were seeking to oblige him, by their insults, to offer his resignation. In the anger which he felt at the infamous stratagem (according to him) employed against Julien, he related the latter's story to the Marquis. Although extremely rich, this great nobleman was not in the least a miser. He had never once been able to make the abbe Pirard accept so much as the cost of postage occasioned by the lawsuit. He took the op- portunity to send five hundred francs to the abbe's favourite pupil. M. de La Mole took the trouble to write the covering letter with his own hand. This set him thinking of the abbe.

One day the latter received a short note in which he was requested to call at once, upon urgent business, at an inn on the outskirts of Besancon. There he found M. de La Mole's steward. 'M. le Marquis has instructed me to bring you his carriage,' he was in- formed. 'He hopes that after you have read this letter, you will find it convenient to start for Paris, in four or five days from now. I am going to employ the time which you will be so kind as to indicate to me in visit- ing the estates of M. le Marquis in the Franche-Comte. After which, on whatever day suits you, we shall start for Paris.' The letter was brief: 'Rid yourself, my dear Sir, of all these provincial bickerings, come and breathe a calmer air in Paris. I am sending you my carriage, which has orders to await your decision for four days. I shall wait for you myself, in Paris, until Tuesday. It requires only the word yes, from you, Sir, to make me accept in your name one of the best livings in the neighbour- hood of Paris. The wealthiest of your future parishioners has never set eyes on you, but is devoted to you more warmly than you can suppose; he is the Marquis de La Mole.' Without knowing it, the stern abbe Pirard loved this Seminary, peopled with his enemies, to which, for fifteen years, he had devoted all his thoughts. M. de La Mole's letter was to him like the sudden appear- ance of a surgeon with the duty of performing a painful but necessary operation. His dismissal was certain. He gave the steward an appoint- ment, in three days' time. For the next forty-eight hours, he was in a fever of uncertainty. Finally, he wrote to M. de La Mole and composed, for the Bishop's benefit, a let- ter, a masterpiece of ecclesiastical diction, though a trifle long. It would have been difficult to find language more irreproachable, or breathing a more sincere respect. And yet this letter, intended to give M. de Frilair a trying hour with his patron, enumerated all the serious grounds for com- plaint and descended to the sordid little pinpricks which, after he had borne them, with resignation, for six years, were forcing the abbe Pirard to leave the diocese. They stole the wood from his shed, they poisoned his dog, etc., etc. This letter written, he sent to awaken Julien who, at eight o'clock in the evening, was already asleep, as were all the seminarists. 'You know where the Bishop's Palace is?' he said to him in the best Latin; 'take this letter to Monseigneur. I shall not attempt to conceal from you that I am sending you amongst wolves. Be all eyes and ears. No pre- varication in your answers; but remember that the man who is

questioning you would perhaps take a real delight in trying to harm you. I am glad, my child, to give you this experience before I leave you, for I do not conceal from you that the letter which you are taking contains my resignation.' Julien did not move; he was fond of the abbe Pirard. In vain might prudence warn him: 'After this worthy man's departure, the Sacred Heart party will de- grade and perhaps even expel me.' He could not think about himself. What embarrassed him was a sen- tence which he wished to cast in a polite form, but really he was incap- able of using his mind. 'Well, my friend, aren't you going?' 'You see, Sir, they say,' Julien began timidly, 'that during your long ad- ministration here, you have never put anything aside. I have six hundred francs.' Tears prevented him from continuing. 'That too will be noticed,' said the ex-Director of the Seminary coldly. 'Go to the Palace, it is getting late.' As luck would have it, that evening M. l'abbe de Frilair was in attend- ance in the Bishop's parlour; Monseigneur was dining at the Prefecture. So that it was to M. de Frilair himself that Julien gave the letter, but he did not know who he was. Julien saw with astonishment that this priest boldly opened the letter addressed to the Bishop. The fine features of the Vicar-General soon re- vealed a surprise mingled with keen pleasure, and his gravity increased. While he was reading, Julien, struck by his good looks, had time to ex- amine him. It was a face that would have had more gravity but for the extreme subtlety that appeared in certain of its features, and would actu- ally have suggested dishonesty, if the owner of that handsome face had ceased for a moment to control it. The nose, which was extremely prom- inent, formed an unbroken and perfectly straight line, and gave unfortu- nately to a profile that otherwise was most distinguished, an irremedi- able resemblance to the mask of a fox. In addition, this abbe who seemed so greatly interested in M. Pirard's resignation, was dressed with an eleg- ance that greatly pleased Julien, who had never seen its like on any other priest. It was only afterwards that Julien learned what was the abbe de Frilair's special talent. He knew how to amuse his Bishop, a pleasant old man, made to live in Paris, who regarded Besancon as a place of exile. This Bishop was extremely short-sighted, and passionately fond of fish.

The abbe de Frilair used to remove the bones from the fish that was set before Monseigneur. Julien was silently watching the abbe as he read over again the letter of resignation, when suddenly the door burst open. A lackey, richly attired, passed rapidly through the room. Julien had barely time to turn towards the door; he saw a little old man, wearing a pectoral cross. He fell on his knees: the Bishop bestowed a kind smile upon him as he passed through the room. The handsome abbe followed him, and Julien was left alone in this parlour, the pious magnificence of which he could now admire at his leisure. The Bishop of Besancon, a man of character, tried, but not crushed by the long hardships of the Emigration, was more than seventy-five, and cared infinitely little about what might happen in the next ten years. 'Who is that clever-looking seminarist, whom I seemed to see as I passed?' said the Bishop. 'Ought they not, by my orders, to be in their beds at this hour?' 'This one is quite wide awake, I assure you, Monseigneur, and he brings great news: the resignation of the only Jansenist left in your dio- cese. That terrible abbe Pirard understands at last the meaning of a hint.' 'Well,' said the Bishop with a laugh, 'I defy you to fill his place with a man of his quality. And to show you the value of the man, I invite him to dine with me tomorrow.' The Vicar-General wished to insinuate a few words as to the choice of a successor. The prelate, little disposed to discuss business, said to him: 'Before we put in the next man, let us try to discover why this one is going. Fetch me in that seminarist, the truth is to be found in the mouths of babes.' Julien was summoned: 'I shall find myself trapped between two in- quisitors,' he thought. Never had he felt more courageous. At the moment of his entering the room, two tall valets, better dressed than M. Valenod himself, were disrobing Monseigneur. The prelate, be- fore coming to the subject of M. Pirard, thought fit to question Julien about his studies. He touched upon dogma, and was amazed. Presently he turned to the Humanities, Virgil, Horace, Cicero. 'Those names,' thought Julien, 'earned me my number 198. I have nothing more to lose, let us try to shine.' He was successful; the prelate, an excellent humanist himself, was enchanted. At dinner at the Prefecture, a girl, deservedly famous, had recited the poem of La Madeleine. 6 He was in the mood for literary conversation, 6.A poem by Delphine Gay

and at once forgot the abbe Pirard and everything else, in discussing with the seminarist the important question, whether Horace had been rich or poor. The prelate quoted a number of odes, but at times his memory began to fail him, and immediately Julien would recite the en- tire ode, with a modest air; what struck the Bishop was that Julien never departed from the tone of the conversation; he said his twenty or thirty Latin verses as he would have spoken of what was going on in his Sem- inary. A long discussion followed of Virgil and Cicero. At length the pre- late could not refrain from paying the young seminarist a compliment. 'It would be impossible to have studied to better advantage.' 'Monseigneur,' said Julien, 'your Seminary can furnish you with one hundred and ninety-seven subjects far less unworthy of your esteemed approval.' 'How so?' said the prelate, astonished at this figure. 'I can support with official proof what I have the honour to say before Monseigneur. 'At the annual examination of the Seminary, answering questions upon these very subjects which have earned me, at this moment, Monseigneur's approval, I received the number 198.' 'Ah! This is the abbe Pirard's favourite,' exclaimed the Bishop, with a laugh, and with a glance at M. de Frilair; 'we ought to have expected this; but it is all in fair play. Is it not the case, my friend,' he went on, turning to Julien, 'that they waked you from your sleep to send you here?' 'Yes, Monseigneur. I have never left the Seminary alone in my life but once, to go and help M. l'abbe Chas-Bernard to decorate the Cathedral, on the feast of Corpus Christi.' 'Optime,' said the Bishop; 'what, it was you that showed such great courage, by placing the bunches of plumes on the baldachino? They make me shudder every year; I am always afraid of their costing me a man's life. My friend, you will go far; but I do not wish to cut short your career, which will be brilliant, by letting you die of hunger.' And, on an order from the Bishop, the servants brought in biscuits and Malaga wine, to which Julien did honour, and even more so than abbe Frilair, who knew that his Bishop liked to see him eat cheerfully and with a good appetite. The prelate, growing more and more pleased with the close of his evening, spoke for a moment of ecclesiastical history. He saw that Julien did not understand. He then passed to the moral conditions of the Ro- man Empire, under the Emperors of the Age of Constantine. The last days of paganism were accompanied by that state of uneasiness and

doubt which, in the nineteenth century, is disturbing sad and weary minds. Monseigneur remarked that Julien seemed hardly to know even the name of Tacitus. Julien replied with candour, to the astonishment of the prelate, that this author was not to be found in the library of the Seminary. 'I am really delighted to hear it,' said the Bishop merrily. 'You relieve me of a difficulty; for the last ten minutes, I have been trying to think of a way of thanking you for the pleasant evening which you have given me, and certainly in a most unexpected manner. Although the gift is scarcely canonical, I should like to give you a set of Tacitus.' The prelate sent for eight volumes handsomely bound, and insisted upon writing with his own hand, on the title-page of the first, a Latin in- scription to Julien Sorel. The Bishop prided himself on his fine Latinity; he ended by saying to him, in a serious tone, completely at variance with his tone throughout the rest of the conversation: 'Young man, if you are wise, you shall one day have the best living in my diocese, and not a hundred leagues from my episcopal Palace; but you must be wise.' Julien, burdened with his volumes, left the Palace, in great bewilder- ment, as midnight was striking. Monseigneur had not said a word to him about the abbe Pirard. Julien was astonished most of all by the extreme politeness shown him by the Bishop. He had never imagined such an urbanity of form, combined with so natural an air of dignity. He was greatly struck by the contrast when he set eyes once more on the sombre abbe Pirard, who awaited him with growing impatience. 'Quid tibi dixerunt? (What did they say to you?)' he shouted at the top of his voice, the moment Julien came within sight. Then, as Julien found some difficulty in translating the Bishop's con- versation into Latin: 'Speak French, and repeat to me Monseigneur's own words, without adding or omitting anything,' said the ex-Director of the Seminary, in his harsh tone and profoundly inelegant manner. 'What a strange present for a Bishop to make to a young seminarist,' he said as he turned the pages of the sumptuous Tacitus, the gilded edges of which seemed to fill him with horror. Two o'clock was striking when, after a detailed report of everything, he allowed his favourite pupil to retire to his own room.

'Leave me the first volume of your Tacitus, which contains the Bishop's inscription,' he said to him. 'That line of Latin will be your light- ning conductor in this place, when I have gone. 'Erit tibi, fili mi, successor meus tanquam leo quaerens quern devoret. (My successor will be to you, my son, as a lion seeking whom he may devour.)' On the following morning, Julien detected something strange in the manner in which his companions addressed him. This made him all the more reserved. 'Here,' he thought, 'we have the effect of M. Pirard's resignation. It is known throughout the place, and I am supposed to be his favourite. There must be an insult behind this attitude'; but he could not discover it. There was, on the contrary, an absence of hatred in the eyes of all whom he encountered in the dormitories. 'What can this mean? It is doubtless a trap, we are playing a close game.' At length the young seminarist from Verrieres said to him with a laugh: 'Cornelii Taciti opera omnia (Complete Works of Tacitus).' At this speech, which was overheard, all the rest seemed to vie with one another in congratulating Julien, not only upon the magnificent present which he had received from Monseigneur, but also upon the two hours of conversation with which he had been honoured. It was common knowledge, down to the most trifling details. From this moment, there was no more jealousy; everyone paid court to him most humbly; the abbe Castanede who, only yesterday, had treated him with the utmost insolence, came to take him by the arm and invited him to luncheon. Owing to a weakness in Julien's character, the insolence of these coarse creatures had greatly distressed him; their servility caused him disgust and no pleasure. Towards midday, the abbe Pirard took leave of his pupils, not without first delivering a severe allocution. 'Do you seek the honours of this world,' he said to them, 'all social advantages, the pleasure of command- ing men, that of defying the laws and of being insolent to all men with impunity? Or indeed do you seek your eternal salvation? The most ig- norant among you have only to open their eyes to distinguish between the two paths.' No sooner had he left than the devotees of the Sacred Heart of Jesus went to chant a Te Deum in the chapel. Nobody in the Seminary took the late Director's allocution seriously. 'He is very cross at being dismissed,' was what might be heard on all sides. Not one seminarist was simple enough to believe in the voluntary resignation of a post which provided so many opportunities for dealing with the big contractors.

The abbe Pirard took up his abode in the best inn in Besancon; and on the pretext of some imaginary private affairs, proposed to spend a couple of days there. The Bishop invited him to dinner, and, to tease his Vicar-General, de Frilair, endeavoured to make him shine. They had reached the dessert when there arrived from Paris the strange tidings that the abbe Pirard was appointed to the splendid living of N ——, within four leagues of the capital. The worthy prelate congratulated him sincerely. He saw in the whole affair a well played game which put him in a good humour and gave him the highest opinion of the abbe's talents. He bestowed upon him a magnificent certificate in Latin, and silenced the abbe de Fri- lair, who ventured to make remonstrances. That evening, Monseigneur carried his admiration to the drawing- room of the Marquise de Rubempre. It was a great piece of news for the select society of Besancon; people were lost in conjectures as to the mean- ing of this extraordinary favour. They saw the abbe Pirard a Bishop already. The sharper wits supposed M. de La Mole to have become a Minister, and allowed themselves that evening to smile at the imperious airs which M. l'abbe de Frilair assumed in society. Next morning, the abbe Pirard was almost followed through the streets, and the tradesmen came out to their shop-doors when he went to beg an audience of the Marquis's judges. For the first time, he was re- ceived by them with civility. The stern Jansenist, indignant at everything that he saw around him, spent a long time at work with the counsel whom he had chosen for the Marquis de La Mole, and then left for Paris. He was so foolish as to say to two or three lifelong friends who escorted him to the carriage and stood admiring its heraldic blason, that after gov- erning the Seminary for fifteen years he was leaving Besancon with five hundred and twenty francs in savings. These friends embraced him with tears in their eyes, and then said to one another: The good abbe might have spared himself that lie, it is really too absurd.' The common herd, blinded by love of money, were not fitted to under- stand that it was in his sincerity that the abbe Pirard had found the strength to fight single-handed for six years against Marie Alacoque, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Jesuits and his Bishop.

Chapter Ambition There is only one true nobility left; namely, the title of Duke; Mar- quis is absurd, at the word Duke one turns one's head. The Edinburgh Review7 The Marquis de La Mole received the abbe Pirard without any of those little mannerisms of a great gentleman, outwardly so polite, but so im- pertinent to him who understands them. It would have been a waste of time, and the Marquis was so far immersed in public business as to have no time to waste. For six months he had been intriguing to make both King and nation accept a certain Ministry, which, as a mark of gratitude, would make him a Duke. The Marquis had appealed in vain, year after year, to his lawyer at Besancon for a clear and definite report on his lawsuits in the Franche- Comte. How was the eminent lawyer to explain them to him, if he did not understand them himself? The little slip of paper which the abbe gave him explained everything. 'My dear abbe,' said the Marquis, after polishing off in less than five minutes all the polite formulas and personal inquiries, 'my dear abbe, in the midst of my supposed prosperity, I lack the time to occupy myself seriously with two little matters which nevertheless are of considerable importance: my family and my affairs. I take the greatest interest in the fortunes of my house, I may carry it far; I look after my pleasures, and that is what must come before everything else, at least in my eyes,' he went on, noticing the astonishment in the eyes of the abbe Pirard. Al- though a man of sense, the abbe was amazed to see an old man talking so openly of his pleasures. 7.I have translated this motto, which is quoted in French by Stendahl, but have not been able to find the original passage in the Edinburgh Review.

'Work does no doubt exist in Paris,' the great nobleman continued, 'but perched in the attics; and as soon as I come in contact with a man, he takes an apartment on the second floor, and his wife starts a day; con- sequently, no more work, no effort except to be or to appear to be a man of fashion. That is their sole interest once they are provided with bread. 'For my lawsuits, to be strictly accurate, and also for each lawsuit sep- arately, I have lawyers who work themselves to death; one of them died of consumption, the day before yesterday. But, for my affairs in general, would you believe, Sir, that for the last three years I have given up hope of finding a man who, while he is writing for me, will deign to think a little seriously of what he is doing. However, all this is only a preamble. 'I respect you, and, I would venture to add, although we meet for the first time, I like you. Will you be my secretary, with a salary of eight thousand francs, or indeed twice that sum? I shall gain even more, I as- sure you; and I shall make it my business to keep your fine living for you, for the day on which we cease to agree.' The abbe declined, but towards the end of the conversation, the sight of the Marquis's genuine embarrassment suggested an idea to him. 'I have left down in my Seminary a poor young man who, if I be not mistaken, is going to be brutally persecuted. If he were only a simple monk he would be already in pace. 'At present this young man knows only Latin and the Holy Scriptures; but it is by no means impossible that one day he may display great tal- ent, either for preaching or for the guidance of souls. I do not know what he will do; but he has the sacred fire, he may go far. I intended to give him to our Bishop, should one ever be sent to us who had something of your way of looking at men and affairs.' 'What is your young man's origin?' said the Marquis. 'He is said to be the son of a carpenter in our mountains, but I am in- clined to believe that he is the natural son of some rich man. I have seen him receive an anonymous or pseudonymous letter containing a bill of exchange for five hundred francs.' 'Ah! It is Julien Sorel,' said the Marquis. 'How do you know his name?' asked the astonished abbe; and, as he was blushing at his own question: 'That is what I am not going to tell you,' replied the Marquis. 'Very well!' the abbe went on, 'you might try making him your secret- ary, he has energy, and judgment; in short, it is an experiment worth trying.'

'Why not?' said the Marquis; 'but would he be the sort of man to let his palm be greased by the Prefect of Police or by anyone else, to play the spy on me? That is my only objection.' Receiving favourable assurances from the abbe Pirard, the Marquis produced a note for one thousand francs: 'Send this to Julien Sorel for his journey; tell him to come to me.' 'One can see,' said the abbe Pirard, 'that you live in Paris! You are un- aware of the tyranny that weighs upon us poor provincials, and espe- cially upon priests who are not on good terms with the Jesuits. They will never allow Julien Sorel to leave, they will manage to cover themselves with the cleverest excuses, they will reply that he is ill, letters will have gone astray in the post,' etc., etc. 'One of these days I shall procure a letter from the Minister to the Bish- op,' said the Marquis. 'I was forgetting one thing,' said the abbe: 'this young man, although of quite humble birth, has a proud heart, he will be of no use to you if his pride is offended; you will only make him stupid.' 'I like that,' said the Marquis, 'I shall make him my son's companion, will that do?' Some time after this, Julien received a letter in an unknown hand and bearing the postmark of Chalons, and found a draft upon a merchant in Besancon and instructions to proceed to Paris without delay. The letter was signed with an assumed name, but as he opened it Julien trembled: a leaf from a tree had fallen out at his feet; it was the signal arranged between him and the abbe Pirard. Within an hour, Julien was summoned to the Bishop's Palace, where he found himself greeted with a wholly fatherly welcome. Interspersed with quotations from Horace, Monseigneur paid him, with regard to the exalted destiny that awaited him in Paris, a number of very neat compli- ments, which required an explanation if he were to express his thanks. Julien could say nothing, chiefly because he knew nothing, and Monsei- gneur showed a high regard for him. One of the minor clergy of the Palace wrote to the Mayor who made haste to appear in person bringing a passport already signed, but with a blank space for the name of the traveller. Before midnight, Julien was with Fouque, whose sober mind was more astonished than delighted by the future which seemed to be in store for his friend. 'The end of it will be,' said this Liberal elector, 'a post under Govern- ment, which will oblige you to take some action that will be pilloried in

the newspapers. It will be through your disgrace that I shall have news of you. Remember that, even financially speaking, it is better to earn one hundred louis in an honest trade in timber, where you are your own master, than to receive four thousand francs from a Government, were it that of King Solomon himself.' Julien saw no more in this than the pettiness of a rustic mind. He was at last going to appear on the stage of great events. The good fortune of going to Paris, which he peopled in his imagination with men of intelli- gence, great intriguers, great hypocrites, but as courteous as the Bishop of Besancon and the Bishop of Agde, eclipsed everything else in his eyes. He represented himself to his friend as deprived of his free will by the abbe Pirard's letter. Towards noon on the following day he arrived in Verrieres the happi- est of men, he reckoned upon seeing Madame de Renal again. He went first of all to his original protector, the good abbe Chelan. He met with a stern reception. 'Do you consider that you are under any obligation to me?' said M. Chelan, without acknowledging his greeting. 'You will take luncheon with me, meanwhile another horse will be hired for you, and you will leave Verrieres, without seeing anyone.' 'To hear is to obey,' replied Julien, with the prim face of a seminarist; and there was no further discussion save of theology and Latin scholarship. He mounted his horse, rode a league, after which, coming upon a wood, with no one to see him enter it, he hid himself there. At sunset he sent the horse back. Later on, he entered the house of a peasant, who agreed to sell him a ladder, and to go with him, carrying the ladder, to the little wood that overhung the Cours de la Fidelite, in Verrieres. 'We are a poor conscript deserting—or a smuggler,' said the peasant, as he took leave of him, 'but what do I care? My ladder is well paid for, and I myself have had to pass some awkward moments in my life.' The night was very dark. About one o'clock in the morning, Julien, car- rying his ladder, made his way into Verrieres. He climbed down as soon as he could into the bed of the torrent, which ran through M. de Renal's magnificent gardens at a depth of ten feet, and confined between walls. Julien climbed up easily by his ladder. 'What sort of greeting will the watch-dogs give me?' he wondered. 'That is the whole question.' The dogs barked, and rushed towards him; but he whistled softly, and they came and fawned upon him.

Then climbing from terrace to terrace, although all the gates were shut, he had no difficulty in arriving immediately beneath the window of Ma- dame de Renal's bedroom, which, on the garden side, was no more than nine or ten feet above the ground. There was in the shutters a small opening in the shape of a heart, which Julien knew well. To his great dismay, this little opening was not lighted by the glimmer of a nightlight within. 'Great God!' he said to himself; 'tonight, of all nights, this room is not occupied by Madame de Renal! Where can she be sleeping? The family are at Verrieres, since I found the dogs here; but I may in this room, without a light, come upon M. de Renal himself or a stranger, and then what a scandal!' The most prudent course was to retire; but the idea filled Julien with horror. 'If it is a stranger, I shall make off as fast as my legs will carry me, leaving my ladder behind; but if it is she, what sort of welcome awaits me? She is steeped in repentance and the most extreme piety, I may be sure of that; but after all, she has still some memory of me, since she has just written to me.' With this argument he made up his mind. His heart trembling, but determined nevertheless to see her or to per- ish, he flung a handful of gravel against the shutter; no reply. He placed his ladder against the wall by the side of the window and tapped himself on the shutter, softly at first then more loudly. 'Dark as it is, they may fire a gun at me,' thought Julien. This thought reduced his mad under- taking to a question of physical courage. 'This room is unoccupied tonight,' he thought, 'or else whoever it is that is sleeping here is awake by this time. So there is no need for any further precaution here; all I need think of is not making myself heard by the people who are sleeping in the other rooms.' He stepped down, placed his ladder against one of the shutters, climbed up again and passing his hand through the heart-shaped open- ing, was fortunate in finding almost at once the wire fastened to the latch that closed the shutter. He pulled this wire; it was with an unspeakable joy that he felt that the shutter was no longer closed and was yielding to his efforts. 'I must open it little by little and let her recognise my voice.' He opened the shutter sufficiently to pass his head through the gap, re- peating in a whisper: 'It is a friend.' He made certain, by applying his ear, that nothing broke the profound silence in the room. But decidedly, there was no nightlight, even half ex- tinguished, on the hearth; this was indeed a bad sign.

'Beware of a gunshot!' He thought for a moment; then, with one finger, ventured to tap the pane: no response; he tapped more loudly. 'Even if I break the glass, I must settle this business.' As he was knocking hard, he thought he could just make out, in the pitch darkness, something like a white phantom coming across the room. In a moment, there was no doubt about it, he did see a phantom which seemed to be advancing with extreme slowness. Suddenly he saw a cheek pressed to the pane to which his eye was applied. He shuddered, and recoiled slightly. But the night was so dark that, even at this close range, he could not make out whether it was Madame de Renal. He feared an instinctive cry of alarm; he could hear the dogs prowling with muttered growls round the foot of his ladder. 'It is I,' he repeated, quite loudly, 'a friend.' No answer; the white phantom had vanished. 'For pity's sake, open the window. I must speak to you, I am too wretched!' and he knocked until the window nearly broke. A little sharp sound was heard; the catch of the window gave way; he pushed it open and sprang lightly into the room. The white phantom moved away; he seized it by the arms; it was a woman. All his ideas of courage melted. 'If it is she, what will she say to me?' What was his state when he realised from a faint cry that it was Ma- dame de Renal. He gathered her in his arms; she trembled, and had barely the strength to repulse him. 'Wretch! What are you doing?' Scarcely could her tremulous voice articulate the words. Julien saw that she was genuinely angry. 'I have come to see you after fourteen months of a cruel parting.' 'Go, leave me this instant. Ah! M. Chelan, why did you forbid me to write to him? I should have prevented this horror.' She thrust him from her with a force that was indeed extraordinary. 'I repent of my crime; heaven has deigned to enlighten me,' she repeated in a stifled voice. 'Go! Fly!' 'After fourteen months of misery, I shall certainly not leave you until I have spoken to you. I wish to know all that you have been doing. Ah! I have loved you well enough to deserve this confidence ... I wish to know all.' In spite of herself Madame de Renal felt this tone of authority exert its influence over her heart.

Julien, who was holding her in a passionate embrace, and resisting her efforts to liberate herself, ceased to press her in his arms. This relaxation helped to reassure Madame de Renal. 'I am going to draw up the ladder,' he said, 'so that it may not com- promise us if one of the servants, awakened by the noise, goes the rounds.' 'Ah! Leave me, leave me rather,' the answer came with unfeigned an- ger. 'What do men matter to me? It is God that sees the terrible wrong you are doing me, and will punish me for it. You are taking a cowardly advantage of the regard that I once felt for you, but no longer feel. Do you hear, Master Julien?' He drew up the ladder very slowly, so as not to make any noise. 'Is your husband in town?' he asked, not to defy her, but from force of habit. 'Do not speak to me so, for pity's sake, or I shall call my husband. I am all too guilty already of not having sent you away, at any cost. I pity you,' she told him, seeking to wound his pride which she knew to be so irritable. Her refusal to use the tu form, that abrupt method of breaking so tender a bond, and one upon which he still reckoned, roused Julien's amorous transport to a frenzy. 'What! Is it possible that you no longer love me!' he said to her, in those accents of the heart to which it is so difficult to listen unmoved. She made no reply; as for him, he was weeping bitter tears. Really, he had no longer the strength to speak. 'And so I am completely forgotten by the one person who has ever loved me! What use to live any longer?' All his courage had left him as soon as he no longer had to fear the danger of encountering a man; everything had vanished from his heart, save love. He wept for a long time in silence. He took her hand, she tried to with- draw it; and yet, after a few almost convulsive movements, she let him keep it. The darkness was intense; they found themselves both seated upon Madame de Renal's bed. 'What a difference from the state of things fourteen months ago!' thought Julien, and his flow of tears increased. 'So absence unfailingly destroys all human feelings! 'Be so kind as to tell me what has happened to you,' Julien said at length, embarrassed by his silence and in a voice almost stifled by tears. 'There can be no doubt,' replied Madame de Renal in a harsh voice, the tone of which offered a cutting reproach to Julien, 'my misdeeds were

known in the town, at the time of your departure. You were so im- prudent in your behaviour. Some time later, when I was in despair, the respectable M. Chelan came to see me. It was in vain that, for a long time, he sought to obtain a confession. One day, the idea occurred to him to take me into that church at Dijon in which I made my first Commu- nion. There, he ventured to broach the subject... ' Madame de Renal's speech was interrupted by her tears. 'What a shameful moment! I con- fessed all. That worthy man was kind enough not to heap on me the weight of his indignation: he shared my distress. At that time I was writ- ing you day after day letters which I dared not send you; I concealed them carefully, and when I was too wretched used to shut myself up in my room and read over my own letters. 'At length, M. Chelan persuaded me to hand them over to him ... Some of them, written with a little more prudence than the rest, had been sent to you; never once did you answer me.' 'Never, I swear to you, did I receive any letter from you at the Seminary.' 'Great God! who can have intercepted them?' 'Imagine my grief; until the day when I saw you in the Cathedral, I did not know whether you were still alive.' 'God in His mercy made me understand how greatly I was sinning against Him, against my children, against my husband,' replied Madame de Renal. 'He has never loved me as I believed then that you loved me ... ' Julien flung himself into her arms, without any definite intention but with entire lack of self-control. But Madame de Renal thrust him from her, and continued quite firmly: 'My respectable friend M. Chelan made me realise that, in marrying M. de Renal, I had pledged all my affections to him, even those of which I was still ignorant, which I had never felt before a certain fatal intim- acy ... Since the great sacrifice of those letters, which were so precious to me, my life has flowed on, if not happily, at any rate quietly enough. Do not disturb it any more; be a friend to me ... the best of friends.' Julien covered her hands with kisses; she could feel that he was still crying. 'Do not cry, you distress me so ... Tell me, it is your turn now, all that you have been doing.' Julien was unable to speak. 'I wish to know what sort of life you led at the Seminary,' she repeated, 'then you shall go.' Without a thought of what he was telling her, Julien spoke of the end- less intrigues and jealousies which he had encountered at first, then of his more peaceful life after he was appointed tutor.

'It was then,' he added, 'that after a long silence, which was doubtless intended to make me understand what I see only too clearly now, that you no longer love me, and that I had become as nothing to you ... ' Madame de Renal gripped his hands. 'It was then that you sent me a sum of five hundred francs.' 'Never,' said Madame de Renal. 'It was a letter postmarked Paris and signed Paul Sorel, to avoid all suspicion.' A short discussion followed as to the possible source of this letter. The atmosphere began to change. Unconsciously, Madame de Renal and Juli- en had departed from their solemn tone; they had returned to that of a tender intimacy. They could not see each other, so intense was the dark- ness, but the sound of their voices told all. Julien slipped his arm round the waist of his mistress; this movement was highly dangerous. She tried to remove Julien's arm, whereupon he, with a certain adroitness, distrac- ted her attention by an interesting point in his narrative. The arm was then forgotten, and remained in the position that it had occupied. After abundant conjectures as to the source of the letter with the five hundred francs, Julien had resumed his narrative; he became rather more his own master in speaking of his past life which, in comparison with what was happening to him at that moment, interested him so little. His attention was wholly concentrated on the manner in which his visit was to end. 'You must leave me,' she kept on telling him, in a curt tone. 'What a disgrace for me if I am shown the door! The remorse will be enough to poison my whole life,' he said to himself, 'she will never write to me. God knows when I shall return to this place!' From that moment, all the element of heavenly bliss in Julien's situation vanished rapidly from his heart. Seated by the side of a woman whom he adored, clasping her almost in his arms, in this room in which he had been so happy, plunged in a black darkness, perfectly well aware that for the last minute she had been crying, feeling, from the movement of her bosom, that she was convulsed with sobs, he unfortunately became a frigid politician, al- most as calculating and as frigid as when, in the courtyard of the Semin- ary, he saw himself made the butt of some malicious joke by one of his companions stronger than himself. Julien spun out his story, and spoke of the wretched life he had led since leaving Verrieres. 'And so,' Madame de Renal said to herself, 'after a year's absence, almost without a single token of remembrance, while I was forgetting him, his mind was entirely taken up with the happy days he had enjoyed at Vergy.' Her sobs

increased in violence. Julien saw that his story had been successful. He realised that he must now try his last weapon: he came abruptly to the letter that he had just received from Paris. 'I have taken leave of Monseigneur, the Bishop.' 'What! You are not returning to Besancon! You are leaving us for ever?' 'Yes,' replied Julien, in a resolute tone; 'yes, I am abandoning the place where I am forgotten even by her whom I have most dearly loved in all my life, and I am leaving it never to set eyes on it again. I am going to Paris ... ' 'You are going to Paris!' Madame de Renal exclaimed quite aloud. Her voice was almost stifled by her tears, and showed the intensity of her grief. Julien had need of this encouragement; he was going to at- tempt a course which might decide everything against him; and before this exclamation, seeing no light, he was absolutely ignorant of the effect that he was producing. He hesitated no longer; the fear of remorse gave him complete command of himself; he added coldly as he rose to his feet: 'Yes, Madame, I leave you for ever, may you be happy; farewell.' He took a few steps towards the window; he was already opening it. Madame de Renal sprang after him and flung herself into his arms. Thus, after three hours of conversation, Julien obtained what he had so passionately desired during the first two. Had they come a little earlier, this return to tender sentiments, the eclipse of remorse in Madame de Renal would have been a divine happiness; obtained thus by artifice, they were no more than mere pleasure. Julien positively insisted, against the entreaties of his mistress, upon lighting the nightlight. 'Do you then wish me,' he asked her, 'to retain no memory of having seen you? The love that is doubtless glowing in those charming eyes, shall it then be lost to me? Shall the whiteness of that lovely hand be in- visible to me? Think that I am leaving you for a very long time perhaps!' Madame de Renal could refuse nothing in the face of this idea which made her dissolve in tears. Dawn was beginning to paint in clear hues the outline of the fir trees on the mountain to the least of Verrieres. In- stead of going away, Julien, intoxicated with pleasure, asked Madame de Renal to let him spend the whole day hidden in her room, and not to leave until the following night. 'And why not?' was her answer. 'This fatal relapse destroys all my self- esteem, and dooms me to lifelong misery,' and she pressed him to her heart. 'My husband is no longer the same, he has suspicions; he believes that I have been fooling him throughout this affair, and is in the worst of

tempers with me. If he hears the least sound I am lost, he will drive me from the house like the wretch that I am.' 'Ah! There I can hear the voice of M. Chelan,' said Julien; you would not have spoken to me like that before my cruel departure for the Semin- ary; you loved me then!' Julien was rewarded for the coolness with which he had uttered this speech; he saw his mistress at once forget the danger in which the prox- imity of her husband involved her, to think of the far greater danger of seeing Julien doubtful of her love for him. The daylight was rapidly in- creasing and now flooded the room; Julien recovered all the exquisite sensations of pride when he was once more able to see in his arms and almost at his feet this charming woman, the only woman that he had ever loved, who, a few hours earlier, had been entirely wrapped up in the fear of a terrible God and in devotion to duty. Resolutions fortified by a year of constancy had not been able to hold out against his boldness. Presently they heard a sound in the house; a consideration to which she had not given a thought now disturbed Madame de Renal. 'That wicked Elisa will be coming into the room, what are we to do with that enormous ladder?' she said to her lover; 'where are we to hide it? I am going to take it up to the loft,' she suddenly exclaimed, with a sort of playfulness. 'But you will have to go through the servant's room,' said Julien with astonishment. 'I shall leave the ladder in the corridor, call the man and send him on an errand.' 'Remember to have some excuse ready in case the man notices the lad- der when he passes it in the passage.' 'Yes, my angel,' said Madame de Renal as she gave him a kiss. 'And you, remember to hide yourself quickly under the bed if Elisa comes into the room while I am away.' Julien was amazed at this sudden gaiety. 'And so,' he thought, 'the ap- proach of physical danger, so far from disturbing her, restores her gaiety because she forgets her remorse! Indeed a superior woman! Ah! There is a heart in which it is glorious to reign!' Julien was in ecstasies. Madame de Renal took the ladder; plainly it was too heavy for her. Julien went to her assistance; he was admiring that elegant figure, which suggested anything rather than strength, when suddenly, without help, she grasped the ladder and picked it up as she might have picked up a chair. She carried it swiftly to the corridor on the third storey, where she

laid it down by the wall. She called the manservant, and, to give him time to put on his clothes, went up to the dovecote. Five minutes later, when she returned to the corridor, the ladder was no more to be seen. What had become of it? Had Julien been out of the house, the danger would have been nothing. But, at that moment, if her husband saw the ladder! The consequences might be appalling. Madame de Renal ran up and down the house. At last she discovered the ladder under the roof, where the man had taken it and in fact hidden it himself. This in itself was strange, and at another time would have alarmed her. 'What does it matter to me,' she thought, 'what may happen in twenty- four hours from now, when Julien will have gone? Will not everything then be to me horror and remorse?' She had a sort of vague idea that she ought to take her life, but what did that matter? After a parting which she had supposed to be for ever, he was restored to her, she saw him again, and what he had done in making his way to her gave proof of such a wealth of love! In telling Julien of the incident of the ladder: 'What shall I say to my husband,' she asked him, 'if the man tells him how he found the ladder?' She meditated for a moment. 'It will take them twenty-four hours to discover the peasant who sold it to you'; and flinging herself into Julien's arms and clasping him in a convulsive em- brace: 'Ah! to die, to die like this!' she cried as she covered him with kisses; 'but I must not let you die of hunger,' she added with a laugh. 'Come; first of all, I am going to hide you in Madame Derville's room, which is always kept locked.' She kept watch at the end of the corridor and Julien slipped from door to door. 'Remember not to answer, if any- one knocks,' she reminded him as she turned the key outside; 'anyhow, it would only be the children playing.' 'Make them go into the garden, below the window,' said Julien, 'so that I may have the pleasure of seeing them, make them speak.' 'Yes, yes,' cried Madame de Renal as she left him. She returned presently with oranges, biscuits, a bottle of Malaga; she had found it impossible to purloin any bread. 'What is your husband doing?' said Julien. 'He is writing down notes of the deals he proposes to do with some peasants.' But eight o'clock had struck, the house was full of noise. If Madame de Renal were not to be seen, people would begin searching everywhere for her; she was obliged to leave him. Presently she returned, in defiance of all the rules of prudence, to bring him a cup of coffee; she was afraid of

his dying of hunger. After luncheon she managed to shepherd the chil- dren underneath the window of Madame Derville's room. He found that they had grown considerably, but they had acquired a common air, or else his ideas had changed. Madame de Renal spoke to them of Julien. The eldest replied with affection and regret for his former tutor, but it appeared that the two younger had almost forgotten him. M. de Renal did not leave the house that morning; he was incessantly going up and downstairs, engaged in striking bargains with certain peas- ants, to whom he was selling his potato crop. Until dinner time, Madame de Renal had not a moment to spare for her prisoner. When dinner was on the table, it occurred to her to steal a plateful of hot soup for him. As she silently approached the door of the room in which he was, carrying the plate carefully, she found herself face to face with the servant who had hidden the ladder that morning. At that moment, he too was coming silently along the corridor, as though listening. Probably Julien had for- gotten to tread softly. The servant made off in some confusion. Madame de Renal went boldly into Julien's room; her account of the incident made him shudder. 'You are afraid'; she said to him; 'and I, I would brave all the dangers in the world without a tremor. I fear one thing only, that is the moment when I shall be left alone after you have gone,' and she ran from the room. 'Ah!' thought Julien, greatly excited, 'remorse is the only danger that sublime soul dreads!' Night came at last. M. de Renal went to the Casino. His wife had announced a severe headache, she retired to her room, made haste to dismiss Elisa, and speedily rose from her bed to open the door to Julien. It so happened that he really was faint with hunger. Madame de Renal went to the pantry to look for bread. Julien heard a loud cry. She re- turned and told him that on entering the dark pantry, making her way to a cupboard in which the bread was kept, and stretching out her hand, she had touched a woman's arm. It was Elisa who had uttered the cry which Julien had heard. 'What was she doing there?' 'She was stealing a few sweetmeats, or possibly spying on us,' said Madame de Renal with complete indifference. 'But fortunately I have found a pate and a big loaf.' 'And what have you got there?' said Julien, pointing to the pockets of her apron.

Madame de Renal had forgotten that, ever since dinner, they had been filled with bread. Julien clasped her in his arms with the keenest passion; never had she seemed to him so beautiful. 'Even in Paris,' he told himself vaguely, 'I shall not be able to find a nobler character.' She had all the awkwardness of a woman little accustomed to attentions of this sort, and at the same time the true courage of a person who fears only dangers of another kind and far more terrible. While Julien was devouring his supper with a keen appetite, and his mistress was playfully apologising for the simplicity of the repast, for she had a horror of serious speech, the door of the room was all at once shaken violently. It was M. de Renal. 'Why have you locked yourself in?' he shouted to her. Julien had just time to slip beneath the sofa. 'What! You are fully dressed,' said M. de Renal, as he entered; 'you are having supper, and you have locked your door?' On any ordinary day, this question, put with all the brutality of a hus- band, would have troubled Madame de Renal, but she felt that her hus- band had only to lower his eyes a little to catch sight of Julien; for M. de Renal had flung himself upon the chair on which Julien had been sitting a moment earlier, facing the sofa. Her headache served as an excuse for everything. While in his turn her husband was giving her a long and detailed account of the pool he had won in the billiard room of the Casino, 'a pool of nineteen francs, begad!' he added, she saw lying on a chair before their eyes, and within a few feet of them, Julien's hat. Cooler than ever, she began to undress, and, choosing her moment, passed swiftly behind her husband and flung a garment over the chair with the hat on it. At length M. de Renal left her. She begged Julien to begin over again the story of his life in the Seminary: 'Yesterday I was not listening to you, I was thinking, while you were speaking, only of how I was to bring my- self to send you away.' She was the embodiment of imprudence. They spoke very loud; and it might have been two o'clock in the morning when they were interrupted by a violent blow on the door. It was M. de Renal again: 'Let me in at once, there are burglars in the house!' he said, 'Saint-Jean found their ladder this morning.' 'This is the end of everything,' cried Madame de Renal, throwing her- self into Julien's arms. 'He is going to kill us both, he does not believe in the burglars; I am going to die in your arms, more fortunate in my death

than I have been in my life.' She made no answer to her husband, who was waiting angrily outside, she was holding Julien in a passionate embrace. 'Save Stanislas's mother,' he said to her with an air of command. 'I am going to jump down into the courtyard from the window of the closet, and escape through the garden, the dogs know me. Make a bundle of my clothes and throw it down into the garden as soon as you can. Mean- while, let him break the door in. And whatever you do, no confession, I forbid it, suspicion is better than certainty.' 'You will kill yourself, jumping down,' was her sole reply and her sole anxiety. She went with him to the window of the closet; she then took such time as she required to conceal his garments. Finally she opened the door to her husband, who was boiling with rage. He searched the bedroom, the closet, without uttering a word, and then vanished. Julien's clothes were thrown down to him, he caught them and ran quickly down the garden towards the Doubs. As he ran, he heard a bullet whistle past him, and simultaneously the sound of a gun being fired. 'That is not M. de Renal,' he decided, 'he is not a good enough shot.' The dogs were running by his side in silence, a second shot apparently shattered the paw of one dog, for it began to emit lamentable howls. Juli- en jumped the wall of a terrace, proceeded fifty yards under cover, then continued his flight in a different direction. He heard voices calling, and could distinctly see the servant, his enemy, fire a gun; a farmer also came and shot at him from the other side of the garden, but by this time Julien had reached the bank of the Doubs, where he put on his clothes. An hour later, he was a league from Verrieres, on the road to Geneva. 'If there is any suspicion,' thought Julien, 'it is on the Paris road that they will look for me.'

She is not pretty, she is not wearing rouge. SAINT-BEUVE

Chapter Country Pleasures O rus, quando ego te aspiciam! VIRGIL [HORACE in earlier edition] 'The gentleman is waiting, surely, for the mail-coach for Paris?' he was asked by the landlord of an inn at which he stopped to break his fast. 'Today or tomorrow, it is all the same to me,' said Julien. The coach arrived while he was feigning indifference. There were two places vacant. 'What! It is you, my poor Falcoz,' said the traveller, who had come from the direction of Geneva to him who now entered the coach with Julien. 'I thought you had settled in the neighbourhood of Lyons,' said Falcoz, 'in a charming valley by the Rhone.' 'Settled, indeed! I am running away.' 'What! Running away? You, Saint-Giraud! With that honest face of yours, have you committed a crime?' said Falcoz, with a laugh. 'Upon my soul, not far off it. I am running away from the abominable life one leads in the country. I love the shade of the woods and the quiet of the fields, as you know; you have often accused me of being romantic. The one thing I never wished to hear mentioned was politics, and polit- ics pursue me everywhere.' 'But to what party do you belong?' 'To none, and that is what has been fatal to me. These are all my polit- ics: I enjoy music, and painting; a good book is an event in my life; I shall soon be four and forty. How many years have I to live? Fifteen, twenty, thirty, perhaps, at the most. Very well; I hold that in thirty years from now, our Ministers will be a little more able, but otherwise just as good fellows as we have today. The history of England serves as a mirror to show me our future. There will always be a King who seeks to extend his prerogative; the ambition to enter Parliament, the glory and the hun- dreds of thousands of francs amassed by Mirabeau will always keep our

wealthy provincials awake at night: they will call that being Liberal and loving the people. The desire to become a Peer or a Gentleman in Wait- ing will always possess the Ultras. On board the Ship of State, everyone will wish to be at the helm, for the post is well paid. Will there never be a little corner anywhere for the mere passenger?' 'Why, of course, and a very pleasant one, too, for a man of your peace- ful nature. Is it the last election that is driving you from your district?' 'My trouble dates from farther back. I was, four years ago, forty years old, and had five hundred thousand francs, I am four years older now, and have probably fifty thousand less, which I shall lose by the sale of my place, Monfleury, by the Rhone, a superb position. 'In Paris, I was tired of that perpetual play-acting, to which one is driv- en by what you call nineteenth-century civilisation. I felt a longing for human fellowship and simplicity. I bought a piece of land in the moun- tains by the Rhone, the most beautiful spot in the world. 'The vicar of the village and the neighbouring squires made much of me for the first six months; I had them to dine; I had left Paris, I told them, so as never to mention or to hear of politics again. You see, I sub- scribe to no newspaper. The fewer letters the postman brings me, the happier I am. 'This was not what the vicar wanted; presently I was besieged with endless indiscreet requests, intrigues, and so forth. I wished to give two or three hundred francs every year to the poor, they pestered me for them on behalf of pious associations; Saint Joseph, Our Lady, and so forth. I refused: then I came in for endless insults. I was foolish enough to show annoyance. I could no longer leave the house in the morning to go and enjoy the beauty of our mountain scenery, without meeting some bore who would interrupt my thoughts with an unpleasant reminder of my fellow men and their evil ways. In the Rogationtide processions, for instance, the chanting in which I like (it is probably a Greek melody), they no longer bless my fields, because, the vicar says, they belong to an unbeliever. A pious old peasant woman's cow dies, she says that it is be- cause there is a pond close by which belongs to me, the unbeliever, a philosopher from Paris, and a week later I find all my fish floating on the water, poisoned with lime. I am surrounded by trickery in every form. The justice of the peace, an honest man, but afraid of losing his place, al- ways decides against me. The peace of the fields is hell to me. As soon as they saw me abandoned by the vicar, head of the village Congregation, and not supported by the retired captain, head of the Liberals, they all fell upon me, even the mason who had been living upon me for a year,

even the wheelwright, who tried to get away with cheating me when he mended my ploughs. 'In order to have some footing and to win a few at least of my lawsuits, I turned Liberal; but, as you were saying, those damned elections came, they asked me for my vote ... ' 'For a stranger?' 'Not a bit of it, for a man I know only too well. I refused, a fearful im- prudence! From that moment, I had the Liberals on top of me as well, my position became intolerable. I believe that if it had ever entered the vicar's head to accuse me of having murdered my servant, there would have been a score of witnesses from both parties, ready to swear that they had seen me commit the crime.' 'You wish to live in the country without ministering to your neigh- bours' passions, without even listening to their gossip. What a mistake!' 'I have made amends for it now. Monfleury is for sale. I shall lose fifty thousand francs, if I must, but I am overjoyed, I am leaving that hell of hypocrisy and malice. I am going to seek solitude and rustic peace in the one place in France where they exist, in a fourth-floor apartment, over- looking the Champs-Elysees. And yet I am just thinking whether I shall not begin my political career, in the Roule quarter, by presenting the blessed bread in the parish church.' 'None of that would have happened to you under Bonaparte,' said Fal- coz, his eyes shining with anger and regret. 'That's all very well, but why couldn't he keep going, your Bonaparte? Everything that I suffer from today is his doing.' Here Julien began to listen with increased attention. He had realised from the first that the Bonapartist Falcoz was the early playmate of M. de Renal, repudiated by him in 1816, while the philosopher Saint-Giraud must be a brother of that chief clerk in the Prefecture of ——, who knew how to have municipal property knocked down to him on easy terms. 'And all that has been your Bonaparte's doing,' Saint-Giraud contin- ued: 'An honest man, harmless if ever there was one, forty years old and with five hundred thousand francs, can't settle down in the country and find peace there. Bonaparte's priests and nobles drive him out again.' 'Ah! You must not speak evil of him,' cried Falcoz, 'never has France stood so high in the esteem of foreign nations as during the thirteen years of his reign. In those days, everything that was done had greatness in it.' 'Your Emperor, may the devil fly away with him,' went on the man of four and forty, 'was great only upon his battlefields, and when he

restored our financial balance in 1801. What was the meaning of all his conduct after that? With his chamberlains and his pomp and his recep- tions at the Tuileries, he simply furnished a new edition of all the stuff and nonsense of the monarchy. It was a corrected edition, it might have served for a century or two. The nobles and priests preferred to return to the old edition, but they have not the iron hand that they need to bring it before the public.' 'Listen to the old printer talking!' 'Who is it that is turning me off my land?' went on the printer with heat. 'The priests, whom Napoleon brought back with his Concordat, in- stead of treating them as the State treats doctors, lawyers, astronomers, of regarding them merely as citizens, without inquiring into the trade by which they earn their living. Would there be these insolent gentlemen today if your Bonaparte had not created barons and counts? No, the fashion had passed. Next to the priests, it is the minor country nobles that have annoyed me most, and forced me to turn Liberal.' The discussion was endless, this theme will occupy the minds and tongues of France for the next half-century. As Saint-Giraud kept on re- peating that it was impossible to live in the provinces, Julien timidly cited the example of M. de Renal. 'Egad, young man, you're a good one!' cried Falcoz, 'he has turned himself into a hammer so as not to be made the anvil, and a terrible ham- mer at that. But I can see him cut out by Valenod. Do you know that ras- cal? He's the real article. What will your M. de Renal say when he finds himself turned out of office one of these fine days, and Valenod filling his place?' 'He will be left to meditate on his crimes,' said Saint-Giraud. 'So you know Verrieres, young man, do you? Very good! Bonaparte, whom heaven confound, made possible the reign of the Renals and Chelans, which has paved the way for the reign of the Valenods and Maslons.' This talk of shady politics astonished Julien, and took his thoughts from his dreams of sensual bliss. He was little impressed by the first view of Paris seen in the distance. His fantastic imaginings of the future in store for him had to do battle with the still vivid memory of the twenty-four hours which he had just spent at Verrieres. He made a vow that he would never abandon his mistress's children, but would give up everything to protect them, should the impertinences of the priests give us a Republic and lead to persecutions of the nobility.

What would have happened to him on the night of his arrival at Verri- eres if, at the moment when he placed his ladder against Madame de Renal's bedroom window, he had found that room occupied by a stranger, or by M. de Renal? But also what bliss in those first few hours, when his mistress really wished to send him away, and he pleaded his cause, seated by her side in the darkness! A mind like Julien's is pursued by such memories for a lifetime. The rest of their meeting had already merged into the first phases of their love, fourteen months earlier. Julien was awakened from his profound abstraction by the stopping of the carriage. They had driven into the courtyard of the posthouse in the rue Jean-Jacques Rousseau. 'I wish to go to La Malmaison,' he told the driver of a passing cabriolet. 'At this time of night, Sir? What to do?' 'What business is it of yours? Drive on.' True passion thinks only of itself. That, it seems to me, is why the pas- sions are so absurd in Paris, where one's neighbour always insists upon one's thinking largely of him. I shall not describe Julien's transports at La Malmaison. He wept. What! In spite of the ugly white walls set up this year, which divide the park in pieces? Yes, sir; for Julien, as for posterity, there was no distinction between Arcole, Saint Helena and La Malmaison. That evening, Julien hesitated for long before entering the playhouse; he had strange ideas as to that sink of iniquity. An intense distrust prevented him from admiring the Paris of today, he was moved only by the monuments bequeathed by his hero. 'So here I am in the centre of intrigue and hypocrisy! This is where the abbe de Frilair's protectors reign.' On the evening of the third day, curiosity prevailed over his plan of seeing everything before calling upon the abbe Pirard. The said abbe explained to him, in a frigid tone, the sort of life that awaited him at M. de La Mole's. 'If after a few months you are of no use to him, you will return to the Seminary, but by the front door. You are going to lodge with the Mar- quis, one of the greatest noblemen in France. You will dress in black, but like a layman in mourning, not like a churchman. I require that, thrice weekly, you pursue your theological studies in a Seminary, where I shall introduce you. Each day, at noon, you will take your place in the library of the Marquis, who intends to employ you in writing letters with refer- ence to lawsuits and other business. The Marquis notes down, in a word or two, upon the margin of each letter that he receives, the type of

answer that it requires. I have undertaken that, by the end of three months, you will have learned to compose these answers to such effect that, of every twelve which you present to the Marquis for his signature, he will be able to sign eight or nine. In the evening, at eight o'clock, you will put his papers in order, and at ten you will be free. 'It may happen,' the abbe Pirard continued, 'that some old lady or some man of persuasive speech will hint to you the prospect of immense advantages, or quite plainly offer you money to let him see the letters re- ceived by the Marquis ... ' 'Oh, Sir!' cried Julien, blushing. 'It is strange,' said the abbe with a bitter smile, 'that, poor as you are, and after a year of Seminary, you still retain these virtuous indignations. You must indeed have been blind! 'Can it be his blood coming out?' murmured the abbe, as though put- ting the question to himself. 'The strange thing is,' he added, looking at Julien, 'that the Marquis knows you ... How, I cannot say. He is giving you, to begin with, a salary of one hundred louis. He is a man who acts only from caprice, that is his weakness; he will outdo you in puerilities. If he is pleased with you, your salary may rise in time to eight thousand francs. 'But you must be well aware,' the abbe went on in a harsh tone, 'that he is not giving you all this money for your handsome face. You will have to be of use to him. If I were in your position, I should speak as little as possible, and above all, never speak of matters of which I know nothing. 'Ah!' said the abbe, 'I have been making inquiries on your behalf; I was forgetting M. de La Mole's family. He has two children, a daughter, and a son of nineteen, the last word in elegance, a mad fellow, who never knows at one minute what he will be doing the next. He has spirit, and courage; he has fought in Spain. The Marquis hopes, I cannot say why, that you will become friends with the young Comte Norbert. I have said that you are a great Latin scholar, perhaps he reckons upon your teach- ing his son a few ready-made phrases about Cicero and Virgil. 'In your place, I should never allow this fine young man to make free with me; and, before yielding to his overtures, which will be perfectly civil, but slightly marred by irony, I should make him repeat them at least twice. 'I shall not conceal from you that the young Comte de La Mole is bound to look down upon you at first, because of your humble birth. He is the direct descendant of a courtier, who had the honour to have his head cut off on the Place de Greve, on the 26th of April, 1574, for a

political intrigue. As for you, you are the son of a carpenter at Verrieres, and moreover, you are in his father's pay. Weigh these differences care- fully, and study the history of this family in Moreri, all the flatterers who dine at their table make from time to time what they call delicate allu- sions to it. 'Take care how you respond to the pleasantries of M. le Comte Norbert de La Mole, Squadron Commander of Hussars and a future Peer of France, and do not come and complain to me afterwards.' 'It seems to me,' said Julien, blushing deeply, 'that I ought not even to answer a man who looks down upon me.' 'You have no idea of this form of contempt; it will reveal itself only in exaggerated compliments. If you were a fool, you might let yourself be taken in by them; if you wished to succeed, you ought to let yourself be taken in.' 'On the day when all this ceases to agree with me,' said Julien, 'shall I be considered ungrateful if I return to my little cell, number 103?' 'No doubt,' replied the abbe, 'all the sycophants of the house will slander you, but then I shall appear. Adsum qui fed. I shall say that it was from me that the decision came.' Julien was dismayed by the bitter and almost malicious tone which he remarked in M. Pirard; this tone completely spoiled his last utterance. The fact was that the abbe felt a scruple of conscience about loving Julien, and it was with a sort of religious terror that he was thus directly interfering with the destiny of another man. 'You will also see,' he continued, with the same ill grace, and as though in the performance of a painful duty, 'you will see Madame la Marquise de La Mole. She is a tall, fair woman, pious, proud, perfectly civil and even more insignificant. She is a daughter of the old Due de Chaulnes, so famous for his aristocratic prejudices. This great lady is a sort of compen- dium, in high relief, of all that makes up the character of the women of her rank. She makes it no secret that to have had ancestors who went to the Crusades is the sole advantage to which she attaches any importance. Money comes only a long way after: does that surprise you? We are no longer in the country, my friend. 'You will find in her drawing-room many great noblemen speaking of our Princes in a tone of singular disrespect. As for Madame de La Mole, she lowers her voice in respect whenever she names a Prince, let alone a Princess. I should not advise you to say in her hearing that Philip II or Henry VIII was a monster. They were KINGS, and that gives them an in- alienable right to the respect of everyone, and above all to the respect of

creatures without birth, like you and me. However,' M. Pirard added, 'we are priests, for she will take you for one; on that footing, she regards us as lackeys necessary to her salvation.' 'Sir,' said Julien, 'it seems to me that I shall not remain long in Paris.' 'As you please; but observe that there is no hope of success, for a man of our cloth, except through the great nobles. With that indefinable ele- ment (at least, I cannot define it), which there is in your character, if you do not succeed you will be persecuted; there is no middle way for you. Do not abuse your position. People see that you are not pleased when they speak to you; in a social environment like this, you are doomed to misfortune, if you do not succeed in winning respect. 'What would have become of you at Besancon, but for this caprice on the part of the Marquis de La Mole? One day, you will appreciate all the singularity of what he is doing for you, and, if you are not a monster, you will feel eternal gratitude to him and his family. How many poor abbes, cleverer men than you, have lived for years in Paris, upon the fif- teen sous for their mass and the ten sous for their lectures in the Sor- bonne! ... Remember what I told you, last winter, of the early years of that wretch, Cardinal Dubois. Are you, by any chance, so proud as to imagine that you have more talent than he? 'I, for example, a peaceable and insignificant man, expected to end my days in my Seminary; I was childish enough to have grown attached to it. Very well! I was going to be turned out when I offered my resignation. Do you know what was the extent of my fortune? I had five hundred and twenty francs of capital, neither more nor less; not a friend, at most two or three acquaintances. M. de La Mole, whom I had never seen, saved me from disaster; he had only to say the word, and I was given a living in which all my parishioners are people in easy circumstances, above the common vices, and the stipend fills me with shame, so far out of proportion is it to my work. I have spoken to you at this length only to put a little ballast into that head of yours. 'One word more; it is my misfortune to have a hasty temper; it is pos- sible that you and I may cease to speak to one another. 'If the arrogance of the Marquise, or the mischievous pranks of her son, make the house definitely insupportable to you, I advise you to fin- ish your studies in some Seminary thirty leagues from Paris, and in the North, rather than in the South. You will find in the North more civilisa- tion and fewer injustices; and,' he added, lowering his voice, 'I must ad- mit it, the proximity of the Parisian newspapers makes the petty tyrants afraid.

'If we continue to find pleasure in each other's company, and the Marquis's household does not agree with you, I offer you a place as my vicar, and shall divide the revenues of this living with you equally. I owe you this and more,' he added, cutting short Julien's expressions of gratit- ude, 'for the singular offer which you made me at Besancon. If, instead of five hundred and twenty francs, I had had nothing, you would have saved me.' The cruel tone had gone from the abbe's voice. To his great confusion, Julien felt the tears start to his eyes; he was longing to fling himself into the arms of his friend: he could not resist saying to him, with the most manly air that he was capable of affecting: 'I have been hated by my father from the cradle; it was one of my great misfortunes; but I shall no longer complain of fortune. I have found an- other father in you, Sir.' 'Good, good,' said the abbe, with embarrassment; then remembering most opportunely a phrase from the vocabulary of a Director of a Semin- ary: 'You must never say fortune, my child, always say Providence.' The cab stopped; the drier lifted the bronze knocker on an immense door: it was the HOTEL DE LA MOLE; and, so that the passer-by might be left in no doubt of this, the words were to be read on a slab of black marble over the door. This affectation was not to Julien's liking. 'They are so afraid of the Ja- cobins! They see a Robespierre and his tumbril behind every hedge; of- ten they make one die with laughing, and they advertise their house like this so that the mob shall know it in the event of a rising, and sack it.' He communicated what was in his mind to the Abbe Pirard. 'Ah! Poor boy, you will soon be my vicar. What an appalling idea to come into your head!' 'I can think of nothing more simple,' said Julien. The gravity of the porter and above all the cleanness of the courtyard had filled him with admiration. The sun was shining brightly. 'What magnificent architecture!' he said to his friend. It was one of the typical town houses, with their lifeless fronts, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, built about the date of Voltaire's death. Never have the fashionable and the beautiful been such worlds apart.

Chapter First Appearance in Society Absurd and touching memory: one's first appearance, at eighteen, alone and unsupported, in a drawing-room! A glance from a wo- man was enough to terrify me. The more I tried to shine, the more awkward I became. I formed the most false ideas of everything; either I surrendered myself for no reason, or I saw an enemy in a man because he had looked at me with a serious expression. But then, amid all the fearful sufferings of my shyness, how fine was a fine day! KANT Julien stopped in confusion in the middle of the courtyard. 'Do assume a reasonable air,' said the Abbe Picard; 'you take hold of horrible ideas, and you are only a boy! Where is the nil mirari of Horace?' (That is: no enthusiasm.) 'Reflect that this tribe of flunkeys, seeing you established here, will try to make a fool of you; they will regard you as an equal, unjustly set over them. Beneath a show of good nature, of good advice, of a wish to guide you, they will try to catch you out in some stu- pid blunder.' 'I defy them to do so,' said Julien, biting his lip; and he recovered all his former distrust. The drawing-rooms through which our friends passed on the first floor, before coming to the Marquis's study, would have seemed to you, gentle reader, as depressing as they were magnificent. Had you been made a present of them as they stood, you would have refused to live in them; they are the native heath of boredom and dreary argument. They redoubled Julien's enchantment. 'How can anyone be unhappy,' he thought, 'who lives in so splendid a residence?' Finally, our friends came to the ugliest of the rooms in this superb suite: the daylight barely entered it; here, they found a wizened little man with a keen eye and a fair periwig. The abbe turned to Julien, whom he presented. It was the Marquis. Julien had great difficulty in

recognising him, so civil did he find him. This was no longer the great nobleman, so haughty in his mien, of the Abbey of Bray-le-Haut. It seemed to Julien that there was far too much hair in his wig. Thanks to this impression, he was not in the least intimidated. The descendant of Henri III's friend struck him at first as cutting but a poor figure. He was very thin and greatly agitated. But he soon remarked that the Marquis showed a courtesy even more agreeable to the person he was addressing than that of the Bishop of Besancon himself. The audience did not oc- cupy three minutes. As they left the room, the abbe said to Julien: 'You looked at the Marquis as you would have looked at a picture. I am no expert in what these people call politeness, soon you will know more about it than I; still, the boldness of your stare seemed to me to be scarcely polite.' They had returned to their vehicle; the driver stopped by the boulevard; the abbe led Julien through a series of spacious rooms. Julien remarked that they were unfurnished. He was looking at a magnificent gilt clock, representing a subject that in his opinion was highly indecent, when a most elegant gentleman approached them with an affable ex- pression. Julien made him a slight bow. The gentleman smiled and laid a hand on his shoulder. Julien quivered and sprang back. He was flushed with anger. The abbe Pirard, for all his gravity, laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks. The gentle- man was a tailor. 'I leave you at liberty for two days,' the abbe told him as they emerged; 'it is not until then that you can be presented to Madame de La Mole. Most people would protect you like a young girl, in these first moments of your sojourn in this modern Babylon. Ruin yourself at once, if you are to be ruined, and I shall be rid of the weakness I show in caring for you. The day after tomorrow, in the morning, this tailor will bring you two coats; you will give five francs to the boy who tries them on you. Other- wise, do not let these Parisians hear the sound of your voice. If you utter a word, they will find a way of making you look foolish. That is their tal- ent. The day after tomorrow, be at my house at midday ... Run along, ru- in yourself ... I was forgetting, go and order boots, shirts, a hat at these addresses.' Julien studied the handwriting of the addresses. 'That is the Marquis's hand,' said the abbe, 'he is an active man who provides for everything, and would rather do a thing himself than order it to be done. He is taking you into his household so that you may save him trouble of this sort. Will you have sufficient intelligence to carry out

all the orders that this quick-witted man will suggest to you in a few words? The future will show: have a care!' Julien, without uttering a word, made his way into the shops indicated on the list of addresses; he observed that he was greeted there with re- spect, and the bootmaker, in entering his name in his books, wrote 'M. Julien de Sorel'. In the Cemetery of Pere-Lachaise a gentleman who seemed highly ob- liging, and even more Liberal in his speech, offered to guide Julien to the tomb of Marshal Ney, from which a wise administration has withheld the honour of an epitaph. But, after parting from this Liberal, who, with tears in his eyes, almost clasped him to his bosom, Julien no longer had a watch. It was enriched by this experience that, two days later, at noon, he presented himself before the abbe Pirard, who studied him attentively. 'You are perhaps going to become a fop,' the abbe said to him, with a severe expression. Julien had the appearance of an extremely young man, in deep mourning; he did, as a matter of fact, look quite well, but the good abbe was himself too provincial to notice that Julien still had that swing of the shoulders which in the provinces betokens at once eleg- ance and importance. On seeing Julien, the Marquis considered his graces in a light so different from that of the good abbe that he said to him: 'Should you have any objection to M. Sorel's taking dancing-lessons?' The abbe was rooted to the spot. 'No,' he replied, at length, 'Julien is not a priest.' The Marquis, mounting two steps at a time by a little secret stair, con- ducted our hero personally to a neat attic which overlooked the huge garden of the house. He asked him how many shirts he had ordered from the hosier. 'Two,' replied Julien, dismayed at seeing so great a gentleman descend to these details. 'Very good,' said the Marquis, with a serious air, and an imperative, curt note in his voice, which set Julien thinking: 'very good! Order your- self two and twenty more. Here is your first quarter's salary.' As they came down from the attic, the Marquis summoned an elderly man: 'Arsene,' he said to him, 'you will look after M. Sorel.' A few minutes later, Julien found himself alone in a magnificent library: it was an exquisite moment. So as not to be taken by surprise in his emotion, he went and hid himself in a little dark corner; from which he gazed with rapture at the glittering backs of the books. 'I can read all of those,' he told himself. 'And how should I fail to be happy here? M. de Renal

would have thought himself disgraced for ever by doing the hundredth part of what the Marquis de La Mole has just done for me. 'But first of all, we must copy the letters.' This task ended, Julien ven- tured towards the shelves; he almost went mad with joy on finding an edition of Voltaire. He ran and opened the door of the library so as not to be caught. He then gave himself the pleasure of opening each of the eighty volumes in turn. They were magnificently bound, a triumph of the best craftsman in London. This was more than was needed to carry Julien's admiration beyond all bounds. An hour later, the Marquis entered the room, examined the copies, and was surprised to see that Julien wrote cela with a double l, cella 'So all that the abbe has been telling me of his learning is simply a tale!' The Marquis, greatly discouraged, said to him gently: 'You are not certain of your spelling?' 'That is true,' said Julien, without the least thought of the harm he was doing himself; he was moved by the Marquis's kindness, which made him think of M. de Renal's savage tone. 'It is all a waste of time, this experiment with a little Franc-comtois priest,' thought the Marquis; 'but I did so want a trustworthy man. 'Cela has only one l,' the Marquis told him; 'when you have finished your copies, take the dictionary and look out all the words of which you are not certain.' At six o'clock the Marquis sent for him; he looked with evident dismay at Julien's boots: 'I am to blame. I forgot to tell you that every evening at half-past five you must dress.' Julien looked at him without understanding him. 'I mean put on stockings. Arsene will remind you; today I shall make your apologies.' So saying, M. de La Mole ushered Julien into a drawing-room resplen- dent with gilding. On similar occasions, M. de Renal never failed to in- crease his pace so that he might have the satisfaction of going first through the door. The effect of his old employer's petty vanity was that Julien now trod upon the Marquis's heels, and caused him considerable pain, owing to his gout. 'Ah! He is even more of a fool than I thought,' the Marquis said to himself. He presented him to a woman of tall stature and imposing as- pect. It was the Marquise. Julien decided that she had an impertinent air, which reminded him a little of Madame de Maugiron, the Sub-Prefect's wife of the Verrieres district, when she attended the Saint Charles's day dinner. Being somewhat embarrassed by the extreme splendour of the

room, Julien did not hear what M. de La Mole was saying. The Marquise barely deigned to glance at him. There were several men in the room, among whom Julien recognised with unspeakable delight the young Bishop of Agde, who had condescended to say a few words to him once at the ceremony at Bray-le-Haut. The young prelate was doubtless alarmed by the tender gaze which Julien, in his timidity, fastened upon him, and made no effort to recognise this provincial. The men assembled in this drawing-room seemed to Julien to be some- how melancholy and constrained; people speak low in Paris, and do not exaggerate trifling matters. A handsome young man, wearing moustaches, very pale and slender, entered the room at about half-past six; he had an extremely small head. 'You always keep us waiting,' said the Marquise, as he kissed her hand. Julien gathered that this was the Comte de La Mole. He found him charming from the first. 'Is it possible,' he said to himself, 'that this is the man whose offensive pleasantries are going to drive me from this house?' By dint of a survey of Comte Norbert's person, Julien discovered that he was wearing boots and spurs; 'and I ought to be wearing shoes, evid- ently as his inferior.' They sat down to table. Julien heard the Marquise utter a word of rebuke, slightly raising her voice. Almost at the same mo- ment he noticed a young person extremely fair and very comely, who was taking her place opposite to him. She did not attract him at all; on studying her attentively, however, he thought that he had never seen such fine eyes; but they hinted at great coldness of heart. Later, Julien de- cided that they expressed a boredom which studies other people but keeps on reminding itself that it is one's duty to be imposing. 'Madame de Renal, too, had the most beautiful eyes,' he said to himself; 'people used to compliment her on them; but they had nothing in common with these.' Julien had not enough experience to discern that it was the fire of wit that shone from time to time in the eyes of Mademoiselle Mathilde, for so he heard her named. When Madame de Renal's eyes became anim- ated, it was with the fire of her passions, or was due to a righteous indig- nation upon hearing of some wicked action. Towards the end of dinner, Julien found the right word to describe the type of beauty exemplified by the eyes of Mademoiselle de La Mole: 'They are scintillating,' he said to himself. Otherwise, she bore a painful resemblance to her mother, whom he disliked more and more, and he ceased to look at her. Comte Norbert, on the other hand, struck him as admirable in every respect. Julien was

so captivated, that it never entered his head to be jealous of him and to hate him, because he was richer and nobler than himself. Julien thought that the Marquis appeared bored. During the second course, he said to his son: 'Norbert, I must ask you to look after M. Julien Sorel, whom I have just taken upon my staff, and intend to make a man of, if that (cela) can be done. 'He is my secretary,' the Marquis added to his neighbour, 'and he spells cela with a double l.' Everyone looked at Julien, who gave Norbert a slightly exaggerated bow; but on the whole, they were satisfied with his appearance. The Marquis must have spoken of the kind of education that Julien had received, for one of the guests tackled him upon Horace: 'It was pre- cisely in discussing Horace that I was successful with the Bishop of Bes- ancon,' Julien said to himself, 'evidently he is the only author they know.' From that moment he was master of himself. This change was made easy by his having just decided that Mademoiselle de La Mole would never be a woman in his eyes. Since his Seminary days he defied men to do their worst, and refused to be intimidated by them. He would have en- joyed perfect self-possession, had the dining-room been furnished with less magnificence. It was, as a matter of fact, a pair of mirrors, each of them eight feet high, in which he caught sight now and then of his chal- lenger as he spoke of Horace, that still continued to overawe him. His sentences were not unduly long for a provincial. He had fine eyes, the sparkle in which was enhanced by his tremulous, or, when he had made a good answer, his happy shyness. This sort of examination made a serious dinner-party quite interesting. The Marquis made a sign to the other speaker to press Julien hard. 'Can it be possible that he does know something?' he thought. Julien found fresh ideas as he answered, and lost enough of his shy- ness not, indeed, to display wit, a thing impossible to a person ignorant of the language that is spoken in Paris, but he had original ideas, albeit expressed without gracefulness or appropriateness, and it could be seen that he had a thorough knowledge of Latin. His adversary was a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, who happened to know Latin; he found in Julien an excellent humanist, lost all fear of making him blush, and really did seek to embarrass him. In the heat of the duel, Julien at length forgot the magnificent decoration of the dining-room, and began to express ideas with regard to the Latin poets, which the other had never read in any book. Being an honest man, he

gave the credit for them to the young secretary. Fortunately, the discus- sion turned to the question whether Horace had been poor or rich: an amiable person, sensual and easy-going, making poetry for his own amusement, like Chapelle, the friend of Moliere and La Fontaine; or a poor devil of a Poet Laureate attached to the court and composing odes for the King's Birthday, like Southey, the traducer of Lord Byron. They spoke of the state of society under Augustus and under George IV; in both epochs the aristocracy was all-powerful! but in Rome it saw its power wrested from it by Maecenas, who was a mere knight; and in Eng- land it had reduced George IV more or less to the position of a Doge of Venice. This discussion seemed to draw the Marquis out of the state of torpor in which his boredom had kept him plunged at the beginning of dinner. Julien could make nothing of all these modern names, such as Southey, Lord Byron, George IV, which he now heard for the first time. But no one could fail to observe that whenever there was any question of historical events at Rome, a knowledge of which might be derived from the works of Horace, Martial, Tacitus, etc., he had an unchallengeable su- periority. Julien appropriated without a scruple a number of ideas which he had acquired from the Bishop of Besancon, during the famous discus- sion he had had with that prelate; these proved to be not the least acceptable. When the party tired of discussing poets, the Marquise, who made it a rule to admire anything that amused her husband, condescended to glance at Julien. 'The awkward manners of this young cleric may per- haps be concealing a learned man,' the Academician, who was sitting near her, said to the Marquise; and Julien overheard something of what he was saying. Ready-made phrases were quite to the taste of his hostess; she adopted this description of Julien, and was glad that she had invited the Academician to dine. 'He amuses M. de La Mole,' she thought.

Chapter First Steps That immense valley filled with brilliant lights and with all those thousands of people dazzles my sight. Not one of them knows me, all are superior to me. My head reels. Poemi dell' avvocato, REINA Early in the morning of the following day, Julien was copying letters in the library, when Mademoiselle Mathilde entered by a little private door, cleverly concealed with shelves of dummy books. While Julien was admiring this device, Mademoiselle Mathilde appeared greatly surprised and distinctly annoyed to see him there. Julien decided that her curlpa- pers gave her a hard, haughty, almost masculine air. Mademoiselle de La Mole had a secret habit of stealing books from her father's library, un- detected. Julien's presence frustrated her expedition that morning, which annoyed her all the more as she had come to secure the second volume of Voltaire's Princesse de Babylone, a fitting complement to an eminently monarchical and religious education, a triumph on the part of the Sacre- Coeur! This poor girl, at nineteen, already required the spice of wit to make her interested in a novel. Comte Norbert appeared in the library about three o'clock; he had come to study a newspaper, in order to be able to talk politics that even- ing, and was quite pleased to find Julien, whose existence he had forgot- ten. He was charming to him, and offered to lend him a horse. 'My father is letting us off until dinner.' Julien appreciated this us, and thought it charming. 'Heavens, Monsieur le Comte,' said Julien, 'if it were a question of felling an eighty-foot tree, trimming it and sawing it into planks, I ven- ture to say that I should manage it well enough; but riding a horse is a thing I haven't done six times in my life.' 'Well, this will be the seventh,' said Norbert. Privately, Julien remembered the entry of the King of —— into Verri- eres and imagined himself a superior horseman. But, on their way back

from the Bois de Boulogne, in the very middle of the Rue du Bac, he fell off, while trying to avoid a passing cab, and covered himself in mud. It was fortunate for him that he had a change of clothes. At the dinner the Marquis, wishing to include him in the conversation, asked him about his ride; Norbert made haste to reply in generous language. 'Monsieur le Comte is too kind to me,' put in Julien. 'I thank him for it, and fully appreciate his kindness. He has been so good as to give me the quietest and handsomest of horses; but after all he could not glue me on to it, and, that being so, I fell off right in the middle of that very long street near the bridge.' Mademoiselle Mathilde tried in vain to stifle a peal of laughter; finally indiscretion prevailed and she begged for details. Julien emerged from the difficulty with great simplicity; he had an unconscious grace. 'I augur well of this little priest,' the Marquis said to the Academician; 'a simple countryman in such a scrape! Such a thing was never yet seen and never will be seen; in addition to which he relates his misadventure before the ladies!' Julien set his listeners so thoroughly at ease over his mishap that at the end of dinner, when the general conversation had taken another turn, Mademoiselle Mathilde began to ply her brother with questions as to the details of the distressing event. As her inquiry continued, and as Julien more than once caught her eye, he ventured to reply directly, although he had not been questioned, and all three ended in laughter, just like three young peasants from a village in the heart of a forest. On the following day Julien attended two lectures on theology, and then returned to transcribe a score of letters. He found ensconced by his own place in the library a young man dressed with great neatness, but his general appearance was ignominious and his expression one of envy. The Marquis entered. 'What are you doing here, Monsieur Tanbeau?' he asked the newcomer in a severe tone. 'I thought,' the young man began with a servile smile. 'No, Sir, you did not think. This is an attempt, but it is an unfortunate one.' Young Tanbeau rose in a fury and left the room. He was a nephew of the Academician, Madame de La Mole's friend, and was intended for a literary career. The Academician had persuaded the Marquis to take him as a secretary. Tanbeau, who worked in a room apart, having heard of the favour that was being bestowed upon Julien, was anxious to share it, and that morning had come and set up his desk in the library.

At four o'clock, Julien ventured, after some hesitation, to seek out Comte Norbert. This young gentleman was going out riding, and was somewhat embarrassed, for his manners were perfect. 'I think,' he said to Julien, 'that presently you might go to the riding school; and after a few weeks I shall be delighted to ride with you.' 'I wished to have the honour of thanking you for all your kindness to me; pray believe, Sir,' Julien added with a most serious air, 'that I am fully conscious of all that I owe you. If your horse is not injured as a res- ult of my clumsiness yesterday, and if it is free, I should like to ride it today.' 'Faith, my dear Sorel, on your own head be it! Assume that I have raised all the objections that prudence demands; the fact is that it is four o'clock, we have no time to lose.' After he was in the saddle: 'What must one do, not to fall off?' Julien asked the young Comte. 'All sorts of things,' replied Norbert with a shout of laughter: 'for in- stance, sit well back.' Julien began to trot. They were crossing the Place Louis XVI. 'Ah! Young hothead, there are too many carriages here, and with care- less drivers too. Once you are on the ground, their tilburys will go bowl- ing over you; they are not going to risk hurting their horses' mouths by pulling up short.' A score of times Norbert saw Julien on the point of falling; but at last their ride ended without mishap. On their return, the young Comte said to his sister: 'Let me introduce a regular dare-devil.' At dinner, speaking to his father, down the length of the table, he did justice to Julien's courage; it was all that one could praise in his method of riding. During the day the young Comte had heard the men who were grooming the horses in the yard make Julien's fall an excuse for the most outrageous mockery of him. In spite of all this kindness, Julien soon felt himself completely isolated among this family. All their customs seemed strange to him, and he was always making mistakes. His blunders were the delight of the footmen. The abbe Pirard had gone off to his living. 'If Julien is a frail reed, let him perish; if he is a man of courage, let him make his way by himself,' he thought.

Chapter The Hotel de La Mole What is he doing here? might it please him? might he think to please? RONSARD If everything seemed strange to Julien, in the noble drawing-room of the Hotel de La Mole, the young man himself, pale and dressed in black, seemed in turn highly singular to those who deigned to notice him. Ma- dame de La Mole suggested that her husband should send him away on business upon days when certain personages were coming to dine. 'I should like to carry through the experiment,' replied the Marquis. 'The abbe Pirard maintains that we do wrong to crush the self-respect of the people we admit into our households. One can lean only upon what resists, etc. There is nothing wrong with this fellow except his uncouth appearance; he might be deaf and dumb.' 'If I am to keep my bearings, I must,' Julien said to himself, 'write down the names and a few words as to the character of the people I see appear in this drawing-room.' At the head of his list he placed five or six friends of the family who paid a desperate court to him, supposing him to be protected by some caprice of the Marquis. These were poor devils, more or less spiritless; but, it must be said in praise of men of this class as they are to be found today in the drawing-rooms of the nobility, they were not equally spirit- less to all comers. Some of them would have let themselves be abused by the Marquis, and yet would have revolted against a harsh word ad- dressed to them by Madame de La Mole. There was too much pride, there was too much boredom in the charac- ter of both host and hostess; they were too much in the habit of insulting people for their own distraction, to be able to expect any true friends. But, except on wet days, and in their moments of furious boredom, which were rare, they were never to be found wanting in politeness.

If the five or six flatterers who treated Julien with such fatherly affec- tion had deserted the Hotel de La Mole, the Marquise would have been left to long hours of solitude; and, in the eyes of women of her rank, solitude is a dreadful thing: it is the badge of disgrace. The Marquis behaved admirably to his wife; he saw to it that her drawing-room was adequately filled; not with peers, he found his new colleagues scarcely noble enough to come to his house as friends, nor en- tertaining enough to be admitted as subordinates. It was not until much later that Julien discovered these secrets. The political questions which form the chief topic in middle-class houses are never mentioned in houses like that of the Marquis, save in times of trouble. So powerful still, even in this age of boredom, are the dictates of the need of amusement, that even on the evenings of dinnerparties, as soon as the Marquis had left the drawing-room, everyone else fled. So long as you did not speak lightly of God, or of the clergy, or of the King, or of the men in power, or of the artists patronised by the court, or of anything established; so long as you did not say anything good of Beranger, or of the opposition press, or of Voltaire, or of Rousseau, or of anything that allowed itself the liberty of a little freedom of speech; so long, above all, as you did not talk politics, you could discuss anything you pleased with freedom. There is no income of a hundred thousand crowns, no blue riband that can prevail against a drawing-room so constituted. The smallest living idea seemed an outrage. Despite good tone, perfect manners, the desire to be agreeable, boredom was written upon every brow. The young men who came to pay their respects, afraid to speak of anything that might lead to their being suspected of thinking, afraid to reveal some forbidden reading, became silent after a few elegantly phrased sentences on Rossini and the weather. Julien observed that the conversation was usually kept going by two Viscounts and five Barons whom M. de La Mole had known during the Emigration. These gentlemen enjoyed incomes of from six to eight thou- sand livres; four of them swore by the Quotidienne, and three by the Gaz- ette de France. One of them had some new story to tell every day of the Chateau, in which the word 'admirable' was lavishly used. Julien re- marked that this man wore five Crosses, whereas the others, as a rule, had no more than three.

On the other hand, you saw in the ante-room ten footmen in livery, and all through the evening you had ices or tea every quarter of an hour; and, at midnight, a sort of supper with champagne. It was for this reason that Julien sometimes remained to the end; other- wise, he failed to understand how anyone could listen seriously to the ordinary conversation of this drawing-room, so magnificently gilded. Now and again he would watch the speakers, to see whether they them- selves were not laughing at what they were saying. 'My M. de Maistre, whom I know by heart, has said things a hundred times better,' he thought; 'and even he is extremely boring.' Julien was not the only one to be aware of the mental stagnation. Some consoled themselves by taking quantities of ices; the others with the pleasure of being able to say for the rest of the evening: 'I have just come from the Hotel de La Mole, where I heard that Russia', etc., etc. Julien learned, from one of the flatterers, that less than six months ago Madame de La Mole had rewarded an assiduity that had lasted for more than twenty years by securing a Prefecture for poor Baron Le Bour- guignon, who had been a Sub-Prefect ever since the Restoration. This great event had rekindled the zeal of these gentlemen; the least thing might have offended them before, now they were no longer offen- ded by anything. It was rare that the incivility was direct, but Julien had already overheard at table two or three brief little passages between the Marquis and his wife, wounding to those who were placed near them. These noble personages did not conceal their sincere contempt for every- one that was not the offspring of people who rode in the King's car- riages. Julien observed that the word Crusade was the only one that brought to their faces an expression of intense seriousness, blended with respect. Their ordinary respect had always a shade of condescension. In the midst of this magnificence and this boredom, Julien was inter- ested in nothing but M. de La Mole; he listened with pleasure one day to his protestations that he was in no way responsible for the promotion of that poor Le Bourguignon. This was a delicate attention to the Marquise: Julien had learned the truth from the abbe Pirard. One morning when the abbe was working with Julien, in the Marquis's library, on the endless litigation with Frilair: 'Sir,' said Julien suddenly, 'is dining every evening with Madame la Marquise one of my duties, or is it a favour that they show me?' 'It is a signal honour!' replied the abbe, greatly shocked. 'M. N——, the Academician, who has been paying assiduous court for the last fifteen years, has never been able to obtain it for his nephew M. Tanbeau.'

'It is to me, Sir, the most tedious part of my employment. I was less bored at the Seminary. I see even Mademoiselle de La Mole yawn at times, although she must be accustomed to the pretty speeches of the friends of the family. I am afraid of falling asleep. Please be so good as to obtain leave for me to go and dine for forty sous in some obscure inn.' The abbe, a regular parvenu, was highly sensible of the honour of din- ing with a great nobleman. While he was endeavouring to make Julien understand what he felt, a slight sound made them turn their heads. Juli- en saw Mademoiselle de La Mole who was listening. He blushed. She had come in search of a book and had heard everything; she felt a certain respect for Julien. 'This fellow was not born on his knees,' she thought, 'like that old abbe. Heavens! How ugly he is.' At dinner, Julien dared not look at Mademoiselle de La Mole, but she was so kind as to speak to him. That evening, they expected a large party; she made him promise to remain. Girls in Paris do not care for men of a certain age, especially when they are not well dressed. Julien did not require much sagacity to perceive that M. Le Bourguignon's col- leagues, who remained in the drawing-room, had the honour to be the customary butt of Mademoiselle de La Mole's wit. That evening, whether with deliberate affectation or not, she was cruel in her treatment of the bores. Mademoiselle de La Mole was the centre of a little group that as- sembled almost every evening behind the Marquise's immense armchair. There, you would find the Marquis de Croisenois, the Comte de Caylus, the Vicomte de Luz and two or three other young officers, friends of Norbert or his sister. These gentlemen sat upon a large blue sofa. At the end of the sofa, opposite to that occupied by the brilliant Mathilde, Julien was silently installed upon a little cane-bottomed chair with a low seat. This modest post was the envy of all the flatterers; Norbert kept his father's young secretary in countenance by addressing him or uttering his name once or twice in the course of the evening. On this occasion, Mademoiselle de La Mole asked him what might be the height of the mountain on which the citadel of Besancon stood. Julien could not for the life of him have said whether this mountain was higher or lower than Montmartre. Often he laughed heartily at what was being said in the little group; but he felt himself incapable of thinking of anything similar to say. It was like a foreign language which he could understand, but was unable to speak. Mathilde's friends were that evening in a state of constant hostility to- wards the people who kept arriving in this vast drawing-room. The

friends of the family had the preference at first, being better known. One can imagine whether Julien was attentive; everything interested him, both the things themselves, and the way they were made to seem ridiculous. 'Ah! Here comes M. Descoulis,' said Mathilde; 'he has left off his wig; can he be hoping to secure a Prefecture by his genius? He is exposing that bald brow which he says is filled with lofty thoughts.' 'He is a man who knows the whole world,' said the Marquis de Crois- enois; 'he comes to my uncle, the Cardinal's, too. He is capable of cultiv- ating a lie with each of his friends, for years on end, and he has two or three hundred friends. He knows how to foster friendship, that is his tal- ent. You ought to see him, covered in mud, at the door of a friend's house, at seven o'clock on a winter morning. 'He hatches a quarrel, now and again, and writes seven or eight letters to keep up the quarrel. Then he is reconciled, and produces seven or eight letters for the transports of affection. But it is in the frank and sin- cere expansion of an honest man who can keep nothing on his conscience that he shines most. This is his favourite device when he has some fa- vour to ask. One of my uncle's Vicars-General is perfect when he relates the life of M. Descoulis since the Restoration. I shall bring him to see you.' 'Bah! I shouldn't listen to that talk; it is the professional jealousy of small-minded people,' said the Comte de Caylus. 'M. Descoulis will have a name in history,' the Marquis went on; 'he made the Restoration with the Abbe de Pradt and M. Talleyrand and Pozzo di Borgo.' 'That man has handled millions,' said Norbert, 'and I cannot conceive why he comes here to swallow my father's epigrams, which are often ap- palling. "How many times have you betrayed your friends, my dear Descoulis?" he shouted at him the other day, down the whole length of the table.' 'But is it true that he has betrayed people?' said Mademoiselle de La Mole. 'Who is there that has not?' 'What!' said the Comte de Caylus to Norbert, 'you have M. Sainclair here, the notorious Liberal; what the devil can he have come for? I must go over to him, and talk to him, and make him talk; they say he is so clever.' 'But how can your mother have him in the house?' said M de Crois- enois. 'His ideas are so extravagant, so enthusiastic, so independent... '

'Look,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, 'there is your independent man, bowing to the ground before M. Descoulis, and seizing his hand. I almost thought he was going to raise it to his lips.' 'Descoulis must stand better with the authorities than we thought,' put in M. de Croisenois. 'Sainclair comes here to get into the Academy,' said Norbert; 'look how he is bowing to Baron L ——, Croisenois.' 'He would be less servile if he went on his knees,' put in M. de Luz. 'My dear Sorel,' said Norbert, 'you who are a man of brains, but have just come down from your mountains, see that you never bow to people as that great poet does, not even to God Almighty.' 'Ah! Here comes a man of brains if you like, M. le Baron Baton,' said Mademoiselle de La Mole, imitating the voice of the footman who had just announced him. 'I think even your servants laugh at him. What a name, Baron Baton!' said M. de Caylus. '"What's in a name?" as he said to us the other day,' retorted Mathilde. '"Imagine the Duc de Bouillon announced for the first time. All the public needs, in my case, is to have grown accustomed to it."' Julien quitted the circle round the sofa. Still but little sensible of the charming subtleties of a light-handed mockery, if he were to laugh at a witticism, he required that it should be founded on reason. He could see nothing in the talk of these young men, but the tone of general depreci- ation, and this shocked him. His provincial or English prudery went so far as to detect envy in it, wherein he was certainly mistaken. 'Comte Norbert,' he said to himself, 'whom I have seen make three rough copies of a letter of twenty lines to his Colonel, would be very glad to have written a single page in his life like those of M. Sainclair.' Passing unperceived owing to his lack of importance, Julien ap- proached several groups in turn; he was following Baron Baton at a dis- tance, and wished to hear him talk. This man of such intelligence wore a troubled air, and Julien saw him recover himself a little only when he had hit upon three or four sparkling sentences. It seemed to Julien that this kind of wit required ample room to develop itself. The Baron could not produce epigrams; he required at least four sen- tences of six lines each to be brilliant. 'This man is holding forth, he is not talking,' said someone behind Julien's back. He turned round and flushed with pleasure when he heard the name of Comte Chalvet. This was the cleverest man of the day. Julien had often come upon his name in the Memorial de Sainte-Helene and in the

fragments of history dictated by Napoleon. Comte Chalvet was curt in his speech; his remarks were flashes of lightning, accurate, keen, pro- found. If he spoke of any public matter, immediately one saw the discus- sion reach a fresh stage. He brought facts to bear on it, it was a pleasure to listen to him. In politics, however, he was a brazen cynic. 'I am independent, myself,' he was saying to a gentleman wearing three decorations, whom he was apparently quizzing. 'Why should I be expected to hold the same opinion today that I held six weeks ago? If I did, I should be a slave to my opinion.' Four grave young men who stood round him made grimaces at this; these gentlemen do not care for the flippant style. The Comte saw that he had gone too far. Fortunately he caught sight of the honest M. Balland, a tartuffe of honesty. The Comte began talking to him: people gathered round them, guessing that poor Balland was going to be scarified. By dint of morals and morality, although horribly ugly, and after early struggles with the world which it would be hard to describe, M. Balland had married an extremely rich wife, who died; then a second extremely rich wife, who was never seen in society. He enjoyed in all humility an income of sixty thousand livres, and had flatterers of his own. Comte Chalvet spoke to him of all this, without pity. Presently they were sur- rounded by a circle of thirty people. Everyone smiled, even the grave young men, the hope of the age. 'Why does he come to M. de La Mole's, where he is obviously made a butt?' thought Julien. He went across to the abbe Pirard, to ask him. M. Balland left the room. 'Good!' said Norbert, 'there's one of my father's spies gone; that leaves only the little cripple Napier.' 'Can that be the clue to the riddle?' thought Julien. 'But, in that case, why does the Marquis invite M. Balland?' The stern abbe Pirard was making faces in a corner of the room, as he heard fresh names announced. 'Why, it is a den,' he said, like Basilic, 'I see none but villains enter.' The fact was that the stern abbe did not recognise the distinguishing marks of good society. But, from his Jansenist friends, he had a very ac- curate notion of the men who make their way into drawing-rooms only by their extreme cleverness in the service of all parties, or by a fortune of notorious origin. For some minutes, that evening, he replied from the abundance of his heart to Julien's eager questions, then cut himself short, distressed to find himself speaking ill of everyone, and imputing it to

himself as a sin. Being choleric and a Jansenist, and regarding Christian charity as a duty, his life in society was a perpetual conflict. 'How frightful that abbe Pirard looks!' Mademoiselle de La Mole was saying, as Julien returned to the sofa. Julien felt a sting of irritation, and yet she was right. M. Pirard was beyond question the most honest man in the room, but his blotched face, distorted by the pangs of conscience, made him hideous at the moment. 'Never judge by appearances after this,' thought Julien; 'it is at the mo- ment when the abbe's scruples are reproaching him with some peccadillo that he looks terrible; whereas on the face of that Napier, whom every- one knows to be a spy, one sees a pure and tranquil happiness.' The abbe Pirard had nevertheless made a great concession to his party; he had en- gaged a valet, and was quite well dressed. Julien remarked a singular occurrence in the drawing-room: this was a general movement of all eyes towards the door, with a lull in the conver- sation. A footman announced the famous Baron de Tolly, to whom the recent elections had attracted universal attention. Julien moved forward and had an excellent view of him. The Baron was returning officer in a certain constituency: he had had the bright idea of making away with the little slips of paper bearing the votes of one of the parties. But, to com- pensate for this, he duly replaced them with other little slips of paper bearing a name of which he himself approved. This decisive manoeuvre was observed by some of the electors, who lost no time in presenting their compliments to Baron de Tolly. The worthy man was still pale after his great excitement. Evil tongues had uttered the word galleys. M. de La Mole received him coldly. The poor Baron hurriedly made his escape. 'If he leaves us so soon, it must be to go to M. Comte's,' 8 said Comte Chalvet; and the others laughed. Amid a crowd of great noblemen who remained silent, and of in- triguers, mostly disreputable, but all of them clever fellows, who arrived one after another that evening, in M. de La Mole's drawing-room (people were speaking of him for a vacant Ministry), young Tanbeau was win- ning his spurs. If he had not yet acquired any fineness of perception, he made up for the deficiency, as we shall see, by the vigour of his language. 'Why not sentence the man to ten years' imprisonment?' he was saying at the moment when Julien joined his group; 'it is in a dungeon under- ground that we ought to keep reptiles shut up; they must be made to die in the dark, otherwise their venom spreads and becomes more 8.A celebrated conjurer of the day.

dangerous. What is the good of fining him a thousand crowns? He is poor, very well, all the better; but his party will pay the fine for him. It should have been a fine of five hundred francs and ten years in a dungeon.' 'Good God! Who can the monster be that they are discussing?' thought Julien, marvelling at his colleague's vehement tone and stilted gestures. The thin, drawn little face of the Academician's favourite nephew was hideous as he spoke. Julien soon learned that the person in question was the greatest poet of the day. 9 'Ah, monster!' exclaimed Julien, half aloud, and generous tears sprang to his eyes. 'Ah, little wretch, I shall make you eat those words. 'And yet these,' he thought, 'are the waifs and strays of the party of which the Marquis is one of the leaders! And that illustrious man whom he is slandering, how many Crosses, how many sinecures might he not have collected, if he had sold himself, I do not say to the lifeless Ministry of M. de Nerval, but to one of those passably honest Ministers whom we have seen succeed one another in office?' The abbe Pirard beckoned to Julien; M. de La Mole had just been say- ing something to him. But when Julien, who at the moment was listen- ing, with lowered gaze, to the lamentations of a Bishop, was free to move, and able to join his friend, he found him monopolised by that ab- ominable young Tanbeau. The little monster loathed him as the source of the favour that Julien enjoyed, and had come to pay court to him. 'When will death rid us of that old mass of corruption?' It was in these terms, with Biblical emphasis, that the little man of letters was speaking at that moment of the eminent Lord Holland. His chief merit was a thor- ough knowledge of the biography of living men, and he had just been making a rapid survey of all those who might aspire to positions of influ- ence under the new King of England. The abbe Pirard moved into an adjoining room; Julien followed him. 'The Marquis does not like scribblers, I warn you; it is his one anti- pathy. Know Latin, Greek if you can, the History of the Egyptians, of the Persians, and so forth; he will honour you and protect you as a scholar. But do not go and write a single page in French, especially upon grave subjects, that are above your position in society; he would call you a scribbler, and would take a dislike to you. What, living in a great nobleman's mansion, don't you know the Duc de Castries's saying about 9.Beranger, sentenced in December, 1828, to imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 francs. C. K. S. M.

d'Alembert and Rousseau: "That sort of fellow wishes to argue about everything, and has not a thousand crowns a year?"' 'Everything becomes known,' thought Julien, 'here as in the Seminary.' He had written nine or ten pages with distinct emphasis: they were a sort of historical eulogy of the old Surgeon-Major, who, he said, had made a man of him. 'And that little copy-book,' Julien said to himself, 'has al- ways been kept under lock and key.' He went upstairs, burned his manuscript and returned to the drawing-room. The brilliant rogues had departed, there remained only the stars and ribands. Round the table, which the servants had just brought in already laid, were seated seven or eight ladies, extremely noble, extremely religious, extremely affected, between thirty and thirty-five years of age. The bril- liant wife of Marshal de Fervaques entered the room, apologising for the lateness of the hour. It was after midnight; she took her place next to the Marquise. Julien was deeply stirred; her eyes and her expression re- minded him of Madame de Renal. The group round Mademoiselle de La Mole was still numerous. She and her friends were engaged in making fun of the unfortunate Comte de Thaler. This was the only son of the famous Jew, celebrated for the riches that he had acquired by lending money to Kings to make war on the common people. The Jew had recently died leaving his son a monthly income of one hundred thousand crowns, and a name that, alas, was only too well known! This singular position required either simpli- city of character or great determination. Unfortunately, the Comte was nothing but a good fellow, adorned with all sorts of pretensions inspired in him by his flatterers. M. de Caylus asserted that he had been credited with the determina- tion to propose for the hand of Mademoiselle de La Mole (to whom the Marquis de Croisenois, who was heir to a Dukedom with an income of one hundred thousand livres, was paying court). 'Ah! Don't accuse him of having any determination,' Norbert pleaded compassionately. What this poor Comte de Thaler most lacked was, perhaps, the power to determine anything. In this respect, he would have made an excellent King. Taking advice incessantly from everybody, he had not the courage to follow out any suggestion to the end. His features would have been enough by themselves, said Mademois- elle de La Mole, to fill her with everlasting joy. His face was a curious blend of uneasiness and disappointment; but from time to time one could make out quite plainly bursts of self-importance, combined with

that cutting tone which the wealthiest man in France ought to adopt, es- pecially when he is by no means bad-looking, and is not yet thirty-six. 'He is timidly insolent,' said M. de Croisenois. The Comte de Caylus, Norbert and two or three young men with moustaches made fun of him to their hearts' content, without his guessing it, and finally sent him away as one o'clock struck. 'Is it your famous pair of arabs that you are keeping waiting in this weather?' Norbert asked him. 'No, I have a new pair that cost much less,' replied M. de Thaler. 'The near horse cost me five thousand francs, and the off horse is only worth a hundred louis; but I must have you understand that he is only brought out at night. The fact is that he trots perfectly with the other.' Norbert's remark made the Comte think that it befitted a man in his position to have a passion for horses, and that he ought not to allow his to stand in the rain. He left, and the other gentlemen took their leave im- mediately, laughing at him as they went. 'And so,' thought Julien, as he heard the sound of their laughter on the staircase, 'I have been allowed to see the opposite extreme to my own po- sition! I have not an income of twenty louis, and I have found myself rubbing shoulders with a man who has an income of twenty louis an hour, and they laughed at him ... A sight like that cures one of envy.'

Chapter Sensibility and a Pious Lady The smallest living idea seems an outrage, so accustomed are people there to words without colour. Woe to the man who in- novates while he speaks! FAUBLAS After many months of trial, this is the stage that Julien had reached on the day when the steward of the household paid him his third quarter's salary. M. de La Mole had set him to study the management of his es- tates in Brittany and Normandy. Julien made frequent journeys to those parts. His principal duty was to take charge of the correspondence relat- ive to the famous lawsuit with the abbe de Frilair. M. Pirard had given him the necessary instructions. > From the brief notes which the Marquis used to scribble on the mar- gins of the papers of all kinds that came to him, Julien composed letters almost all of which were signed. At the school of theology, his teachers complained of his lack of in- dustry, but regarded him none the less as one of their most distinguished pupils. These several labours, taken up with all the ardour of a chafed ambition, had soon robbed Julien of the fresh complexion he had brought with him from the country. His pallor was a merit in the eyes of the young seminarists his companions; he found them much less irritat- ing, much less inclined to fall upon their knees before a coin of the realm than those at Besancon; they, for their part, supposed him to be con- sumptive. The Marquis had given him a horse. Afraid of their seeing him when he was out riding, Julien had told them that this exercise had been ordered him by the doctors. The abbe Pirard had taken him to a number of Jansenist societies. Julien was aston- ished; the idea of religion was inseparably linked in his mind with that of hypocrisy, and the hope of making money. He admired these devout and stern men who took no interest in the budget. Several of the

Jansenists had formed an affection for him and gave him advice. A new world opened before him. He met among the Jansenists a certain Conte Altamira, a man six feet in height, a Liberal under sentence of death in his own country, and a devout Catholic. This strange incongruity, reli- gion wedded to a love of freedom, impressed him. Julien was out of favour with the young Count. Norbert had found that he replied with too much warmth to the pleasantries of certain of his friends. Julien after being guilty once or twice of a breach of good man- ners, had pledged himself never to address another word to Mademois- elle Mathilde. They were always perfectly civil to him at the Hotel de La Mole; but he felt that he had fallen in their esteem. His provincial com- mon sense explained this change in the words of the popular proverb: 'new is beautiful.' Perhaps his perception was now a little clearer than at first, or else the first fascination produced by the urbanity of Paris had ceased. As soon as he stopped working, he fell into the clutches of a deadly boredom; this was the withering effect of the politeness, admirable in it- self, but so measured, so perfectly graduated according to one's position, which is a mark of high society. A heart that is at all sensitive discerns the artificiality. No doubt, provincials may be accused of a trace of vulgarity, or of a want of politeness; but they do show a little warmth in answering one. Never, in the Hotel de La Mole, was Julien's self-esteem wounded; but often, at the end of the day he felt inclined to weep. In the provinces, a waiter in a cafe takes an interest in you if you meet with some accident on entering his cafe; but if that accident involves anything capable of wounding your vanity, then, in condoling with you, he will repeat again and again the word that makes you wince. In Paris they are so consider- ate as to turn their backs to laugh at you, but you will always remain a stranger. We pass without comment over a multitude of minor adventures which would have brought Julien into ridicule had he not been in a sense beneath ridicule. An insane self-consciousness made him commit thou- sands of blunders. All his pleasures were forms of precaution; he prac- tised with his pistol every day, and was numbered among the more promising pupils of the most famous fencing masters. Whenever he had a moment to spare, instead of spending it with a book as at one time, he would dash to the riding school and as ask for the most vicious horses. In his outings with the riding master, he was almost invariably thrown.

The Marquis found him useful owing to his persistent hard work, his reticence and his intelligence, and, by degrees, entrusted him with the handling of all his business that was at all complicated. In those mo- ments in which his lofty ambition allowed him some relaxation, the Mar- quis did his business with sagacity; being in a position to hear all the latest news, he speculated with success. He bought houses, timber; but he took offence easily. He gave away hundreds of louis and went to law over hundreds of francs. Rich men with big ideas seek amusement and not results from their private undertakings. The Marquis needed a chief of staff who would put all his financial affairs into an easily intelligible order. Madame de La Mole, albeit of so restrained a character, would some- times make fun of Julien. The unexpected, an outcome of sensibility, hor- rifies great ladies; it is a direct challenge to all the conventions. On two or three occasions the Marquis took his part: 'If he is absurd in your drawing-room, in his own office he reigns supreme.' Julien, for his part, thought he could divine the Marquise's secret. She deigned to take an in- terest in everything as soon as her servants announced the Baron de La Joumate. This was a chilly creature, with expressionless features. He was small, thin, ugly, very well dressed, he spent all his time at the Chateau and, as a rule, had nothing to say about anything. His speech revealed his mind. Madame de La Mole would have been passionately happy, for the first time in her life, if she could have secured him as a husband for her daughter.

Chapter Pronunciation Their lofty mission is to pass calm judgment on the trivial events in the daily life of nations. Their wisdom should pre-empt any fury caused by little things, or by events which the voice of re- pute transfigures in bruiting them abroad. GRATIUS For a newcomer, who, out of pride, never asked any questions, Julien managed to avoid any serious pitfall. One day, when he had been driven into a cafe in the Rue Saint-Honore by a sudden shower, a tall man in a beaver coat, surprised at his gloomy stare, began to stare back at him ex- actly as Mademoiselle Amanda's lover had stared at him, long before, at Besancon. Julien had too often reproached himself for having allowed the former insult to pass unpunished to tolerate this stare. He demanded an explan- ation, the man in the greatcoat at once began to abuse him in the foulest terms: everyone in the cafe gathered round them; the passers-by stopped outside the door. With provincial caution, Julien always carried a brace of pocket pistols; his hand gripped one of these in his pocket with a con- vulsive movement. Better counsels prevailed, however, and he confined himself to repeating with clockwork regularity: 'Sir, your address? I scorn you.' The persistence with which he clung to these six words began to im- press the crowd. 'Gad, that other fellow who goes on talking by himself ought to give him his address.' The man in the greatcoat, hearing this opinion freely vented, flung a handful of visiting cards in Julien's face. Fortunately, none of them hit him, he had vowed that he would use his pistol only in the event of his being touched. The man went away, not without turning round from time to time to shake his fist at Julien and to shout abuse.

Julien found himself bathed in sweat. 'So it lies within the power of the lowest of mankind to work me up like this!' he said angrily to himself. 'How am I to destroy this humiliating sensibility?' Where was he to find a second? He had made the acquaintance of a number of men; but all of them, after six weeks or so, had drifted away from him. 'I am unsociable, and here I am cruelly punished for it,' he thought. Finally, it occurred to him to apply to a retired Lieutenant of the 96th named Lieven, a poor devil with whom he used often to fence. Juli- en was frank with him. 'I shall be glad to be your second,' said Lieven, 'but upon one condi- tion: if you do not hit your man, you shall fight with me, there and then.' 'Agreed,' said Julien, with delight; and they went to find M. C. de Beauvoisis at the address indicated upon his cards, in the heart of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. It was seven o'clock in the morning. It was only when he sent in his name that it occurred to Julien that this might be Madame de Renal's young relative, formerly attached to the Embassy at Rome or Naples, who had given the singer Geronimo a letter of introduction. Julien had handed to a tall footman one of the cards flung at him the day before, together with one of his own. He was kept waiting, with his second, for fully three quarters of an hour; finally they were shown into an admirably furnished apartment. They found a tall young man, got up like a doll; his features exemplified the perfection and the insignificance of Grecian beauty. His head, re- markably narrow, was crowned with a pyramid of the most beautiful golden locks. These were curled with scrupulous care, not a hair stood out from the rest. 'It is to have his hair curled like that,' thought the Lieu- tenant of the 96th, 'that this damned idiot has been keeping us waiting.' His striped dressing-gown, his morning trousers, everything, down to his embroidered slippers, was correct and marvellously well cared for. His features, noble and vacuous, betokened a propriety and paucity of ideas, the ideal of the well-meaning man, a horror of the unexpected and of ridicule, an abundance of gravity. Julien, to whom his Lieutenant of the 96th had explained that to keep him waiting so long, after rudely flinging his card in his face, was an ad- ditional insult, strode boldly into M. de Beauvoisis's presence. It was his intention to be insolent, but he wished at the same time to show his good breeding. He was so much impressed by M. de Beauvoisis's gentle manners, by his air at once formal, important and self-satisfied, by the admirable

elegance of his surroundings, that in a twinkling all thought of being in- solent forsook him. This was not his man of the day before. So great was his astonishment at finding so distinguished a person in place of the vul- gar fellow he had met in the cafe, that he could not think of a single word to say. He presented one of the cards that had been flung at him: 'This is my name,' said the man of fashion, in whom Julien's black coat, at seven o'clock in the morning, inspired but scant respect; 'but I do not understand, the honour ... ' His way of pronouncing these last words restored some of Julien's ill humour.
